Extract from  the Yorkshire Evening Post, 22/2/49.   I was flogged by Russian Guards.   Grim facts from Bradford DCM.
The Evening Post article last Friday about Russian slave camps had drawn confirmation from a person peculiarly well qualified to give it - a Bradford man who has had personal experience of Soviet prison conditions.   He tells his grim story in the following interview.
Dreams of the inhuman treatment torture and floggings suffered during 13 months imprisonment in the hands of the Russians during the Second World War still awakens former Lance Corporal James S Allen, DCM of the Military Police who lives in Southfield Square Bradford.
     Mr Allen told us of his experiences in six prisons from September when he gave himself up to the Russians in Poland after escaping from Germany, until October 1941, when he was handed over to he British Ambassador in Moscow, then Sir Stafford Cripps.
     Of the treatment in all the prisons, Mr Allen said, ""It was awful, inhuman.   We ere treated worse than dogs.   We were spied on, beaten, starved and interrogated times without number.   The Russians I saw had not the manners of a pig.   They were  a lot of illiterate ignorant beggars.""
     During the 13 months he existed on two meals a day - one of 250 grams (about 2 oz) of bread and a bowl of dry porridge, the other fish soup, both served ""when the guards felt like it.""   Of the soup, Mr Allen said: ""There were fish heads, fins, skin and guts in it, but because we were hungry we ate the lot.
The First Flogging.
     His first flogging was for refusing to sign a statement in Russian,   He received it at a camp near Moscow.   He was stripped to the waist and a whip was used while he was lying on the floor.
     ""Every time we went to a new place we were interrogated by the prison chief, and all kinds of things were alleged against us."" he said.   ""If we did not agree, guards standing behind us used to club us until we did.   So it was best to agree.
     ""I said I would sign the statement if it was written in English.   Even if they had translated it I would have refused again.
     ""They flogged me, but it wasn't too bad, as I got five days solitary confinement to get over it.""
""That Finished Me""
     Mr Allen was flogged the second time at Saratov, in Caucasia.   ""This was a very different thing.   I had learned two Russian  phrases, and I used one of them - ""I want to see the Prison Chief to try to help one of my friends.   That finished me.
     ""As soon as I said that, they accused me of being a spy and an enemy of the Soviet.  I was interrogated, beaten up and charged with all sorts of things.""
     "" I was stripped completely naked and the flogging was wicked.   There were five of them and they did everything they could think of.   The whipped, beat, kicked, bit and ran over me.   I was starving at the time, but I was in such a terrible state that I could not eat for three days.   I still dream of the flogging.""
     At Lubianka prison in Moscow, Mr Allen told me that each morning about 4 o'clock he heard banging noises.   ""I did not know what these were until one morning I saw ten dead bodies in an outhouse.   I could see the bullet holes in their heads and bodies.   Then I knew what the what the banging's were.""
     When he was finally released - three months after the Russians had entered to war as our ally - Mr Allen told Sir Stafford Cripps that he would willingly walk back to captivity with the Germans than stay another minute more than stay in Russia.
     He was still puzzled as to why he was kept a prisoner after Russia  became our ally as other British prisoners were released as soon as Germany invaded Russia.   He thinks his release was due to the efforts of Lord Beaverbrook and the first mission to Moscow with whom he returned to England
DCM for ""sticking it out.""
     He was awarded the DCM on his return - ""I do not know what for, I think it was for being able to stick it out with the Russians.."" he said.
     Another reminder of his stay ten months in hospital in this country, recovering from the after effects of his imprisonment  and the ill health he still has because of it.
     Mr Allen's advice to anyone who thinks Communism is good this is ""Get it out of your head - quick."" .

BRITON ACCUSED OF HELPING GERMANS.   Prisoner's Alleged Activities with Free Corps.
A pamphlet handed to prisoners of war set out the aims of the organisation known as the British Free Corps as being the development of friendly relations between Britain and Germany and to fight Soviet Russia said Lance Corporal W Dexter of the Corps of Military Police at the Court Martial yesterday at Westgate on Sea of Lance Corporal Roy Nicholas Couriander accused of joining the German Army and of helping the Germans.   Other former  associates of Couriander - a Londoner, who joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, told of his alleged Free Corps activities.   Pte Thomas Freeman said that Couriander had from time to time posed as a White Russian and in a statement had declared that his step father was born in White Russia.   He became a prisoner in April, 1941 and in October of that year was apparently a member of a working party, acting as interpreter.   ""He produced a series of propaganda talks purporting to show how the British had failed to keep their pledges after the last war"".   Colonel Hilliyard said.
Talks to Prisoners.   ""They set out the conquests Germany was making and contained a great deal of material about alleged Jewish influences in this country.   In addition he was delivering talks to fellow prisoners, the purpose of these talks that Britain was already defeated.   ""In his statement he set out an interview he had with John Amery.   One of Corianders objectives was to oust Amery from any part in the unit and take over the British Free Corps.   In fact after that the organisation was mainly in the hands of Couriander.  He says that in August 1944 he joined the SS as a propagandist and war reporter.   In that uniform he was sent from Berlin to the Western Front and according to his own account was sent to Brussels to make front line broadcast talks.   He arrived there on September 3rd and the next day was found by the British.   Coriander who wore three service ribbons, pleaded not guilty.   He is defended by Captain C P Hutchinson of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force.   The court adjourned until today."

Extract from the Cheltenham Chronicle, 4/8/1934.   TO BE SUPERINTENDENT AT REDDITCH.
Police Inspector Thomas Watkins Arey, of Pershore, is leaving the district in a few weeks' time.   he has been appointed Superintendent at Redditch.   Inspector Arey was a sergeant at Redditch 13 years ago, and returned there from Astwood Bank in 1925 as Inspector before coming to Pershore.   Now he succeeds Superintendent Frederick Smith, who is retiring from the Force.   Inspector Arey will be much missed by a host of friends in Pershore, for during his eight years he has been in charge of the Pershore District, the second largest in the county, he has discharged his duties with ability and fairness.   The record of criminal cases on which he has been engaged during that period included many of more than ordinary gravity.   Apart from his official duties Mr Arey has found time to give very substantial help to local organisations promoted for the benefit of the town and district, including the Evesham Divisional Boot Fund for Poor Kiddies, originated by Supt. A Pass, which has proved an incalculable boon to many parents during the past six years.   Inspector Arey has raised during that period, with the help of his constables, between five and six hundred pounds for this deserving cause in the Pershore district alone.   As a member of the committee of the local British Legion branch he has loyally fulfilled all the work devolving upon him.   HIS POLICE CAREER.   He joined the Worcestershire Constabulary in 1906 and went to Dudley, which borough was then policed by the county, under the late Chief Supt. Speke.   In 1908 he was transferred to Stourport as divisional police clerk to the late Supt. Walker, formerly of Pershore.   In 1912 he passed the Board of Trade examination and was appointed weights and measures inspector for the Southern Division of Worcestershire with the rank of Sergeant.   During the war he was in France and rose to the rank of sergeant in the Military Foot Police and was acting Quartermaster Sergeant at the time of his demobilisation in 1919.   He then resumed his old appointment in the Weight and Measures Department until transferred to Evehsam as Sergeant-Clerk under Supt. Pegg, of Pershore.   Two years later he went to Astwood Bank, where he was appointed Inspector, and went to Redditch, where he remained until August, 1926, when he came to Pershore, succeeding the late Supt. A Gray, whose promotion and transference to Halesowen occurred at this time.   Mr Aray will be succeeded by Inspector E Price of Tenbury Wells, in the Stourport Division, who has served as constable and Sergeant at Bromsgrove, and who took Mr Arey's place at Astwood Bank in 1925, where he was popular as a sportsman and for his work in connection with charitable institutions."

Extract from the Hampshire Post and Southsea Observer 7 September 1906.
     William Marriott, alias William Bartlett, alias Harry Clanfield, a carpenter was brought up in custody on remand, charged with stealing a hammer and a twist-bit, valued at 3s 6d, the property of Arthur Haywood, a carpenter, at Bordon Camp, on the 25th of August.   From the evidence of the prosecutor, P.C. Savage and P.S. Morris, it appeared that the prisoner and Haywood had been working on the Mission Hall at Bordon and that Haywood on missing the tools mentioned gave information to the police, who discovered the tools at the prisoner's lodgings at Kingsley in an ordinary carpenters basket.   The prisoner admitted that the hammer was not his property but could not explain how it got into his basket.   The twist bit he declared positively to be his own and that the marks by which prosecutor identified it were on all of a similar make.   As the prisoner pleaded not guilty, he was committed for trial.   Arising out of the search of the prisoner's lodgings he was further charged with being in possession of two odd socks, one clothes brush and one shoe brush, military necessaries, on the 27th of August at Kingsley.   P.S. Morris, of the Hants Constabulary and Sergt. Ashley of the Military Mounted Police were the only witnesses.   P.S Morris proved finding the articles when searching the prisoners lodgings on the date named and Sergt. Ashley proved that these articles had evidently belonged to a soldier at Bordon Camp.   P.S. Morris explained that the numbers and marks on the brushes had been planed off, but that some of them were still faintly discernible.   The prisoner said that the socks had been given to him by a soldier, whose name he did not know and averred that any time expired man had a right to do as he liked with his kit, as he himself was a time expired man from the Royal Fusiliers Militia and that the brushed belonged to him.   Mr. Gadban:  Why are the brushes marked ""RFA.""   Prisoner: They are not.   The Chairman told the prisoner that he would be fined 10s or one day's imprisonment,   Thereupon the prisoner declared that he would write to his colonel."

Commendation.   The following is quoted from District Routine Orders issued by Major General G Lammie, CBE, MC, Commanding No. 3 District.   ""The GOC desires to place on record the act of distinguished conduct described below performed by 86035 L/Cpl Ball W. CMP.   On 15 Jul 44 l/cpl BALL was on duty at an AOD RSD accompanied by WAR DOG 2117/4977 ""BLACKIE"".   At approximately 04.20 hours, he entered a warehouse and surprised eight Italian civilians in the act of filling sacks with WD clothing.   He called on them to surrender, but on seeing that he was alone they attacked him with iron tent pegs.   L/Cpl BALL released his dog, which knocked one man to the ground and held him by the back of his neck.   L/Cpl BALL struck one man on the head with the butt of his pistol, and kicked another in the stomach:  both these men were temporarily stunned.   The others then tried to escape, but L/Cpl BALL managed to hold two of them, the other three were arrested in the yard outside by another policeman.  
As a result of the sense of duty and disregard for his own personal safety shown by this NCO, eight civilians were arrested and the theft of a large quantity of WD stores was prevented.
My congratulations to L/Cpl BALL on the courage and devotion to duty he showed on this occasion."

Extract from the Western Times, 3/12/19.   MM FOR PC BARRETT.
Over 300 of the 350 Special Constables, who did duty in Exeter during the war, gathered at Exeter Fuildhall last evening, when they were presented with illuminated certificate expressing appreciation of their services.   The Major (Alderman T Bradley Rowe) presided, and was supported by the Sheriff (Mr Sidney Andrew), the Chief Constable ( Mr A F Nicholson, and members of the Watch Committee.   The certificates were presented by the ex-Mayor (Sir James Owen).   The Major first presented the Military Medal to P C Barrett,   During the war, said the Major, PC Barrett was a Sergeant in the Military Foot Police serving most of the time near the firing line in France and Belgium.   The Military Medal was awarded him for directing traffic at the four cross roads at Dizy, near Epernay, France, on July 23rd and 26th,1918, when there was a big movement on the part of four armies, English, American, French and Italian.   They could easily, having knowledge of what it meant to direct traffic, imagine how great and difficult a task he had to perform.   P C Barrett was loudly applauded when the Mayor handed him the medal.   

Extract from the Exeter and Plymouth Gazette, 5/2/1943.   Exeter Constables Retire.
Two well known members of the Exeter Police Force, Constables John E Barratt and John H Gregory, retired last week-end.   Both holders of the Police Good Service Medal.   Both were in the Army during the last War.
For many years, Constable Barratt has been a familiar figure in Exeter.   A native of Exeter, he worked on the old LSWR, until joining the force in 1913.   He served in France with the Military Foot Police from 1916 to September 1919, and won the Military Medal for bravery.   On The Marne Front. 
Though subjected to heavy fire from aerial attack, he continued to direct traffic and convoys throughout a hotly fought engagement at Dizy, on the Marne front in 1917.   The medal was presented to him on his return to England after the war, by the late Mr T Bradley-Rowe, who was then Major of Exeter.   During his police career, Constable Barratt has been commended on a number of occasions.  His smartness in apprehending two deserters won official recognition, so did his gallantry in assisting to save a woman from drowning, and his prompt and efficient action in subduing a fire at an Exeter foundry."

MILITARY POLICE - RECORD OF MEDAL PRESENTATION.
     We had pleasure in our last issue in reporting a record parade for the presentation of medals for long service and good conduct, this taking place in the Army Service Corps, when fourteen members of that Corps were so decorated.   Now we have pleasure in placing on record an even more remarkable record, which the members of the Military Police have achieved for no fewer than 20 non-commissioned officers of that corps at one time.   The record is the more remarkable from the fact that the whole strength of the Corps is no more than 500, of whom a good proportion are already in possession of the same devotion.   The following are the names of those who have been the latest recipients of the medal :- Sergeant J Cook, 367, Sergeant.

Extract from the Irish Independent, 5/11/2009;  Soldiers Killed by 'rogue' policeman.
     Five soldiers were shot dead by a British trained Afghan policeman who ""went rogue"" and attacked the inside a military compound.
     Warrant Officer Darren Chant, Sergeant Matthew Telford and Guardsman James Major from the Grenadier Guards died alongside Acting Corporal Steven Boot and Corporal Nicholas Webster-Smith from the Royal Military Police.
     They were killed in Nad-e'Ali district of Helmand Province yesterday.
     The British Ministry of Defence named the men but said no further details would yet be released.
     British troops are thought to be involved in a manhunt for the assassin named by tribal elders as Taliban member Gulbuddin another six British soldiers and two Afghan policemen were wounded in the shooting, which was claimed by the Tailban.
     Last night, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to the soldiers describing their deaths as a ""terrible loss"".   He promised to press on with the strategy of training Afghan soldiers and police.
     Mr Brown said "" It appears that they were targeted because they were engaged in what our enemies fear most - they were mentoring and strengthening Afghan forces to make Afghanistan more secure.""
     The British soldiers had been working at the police check point for about a fortnight, mentoring Afghan National Police officers.   Reports suggested they had taken off their armour and were drinking tea with Afghan colleagues when the policeman opened fire."

Extract from the Malta Chronicle and Garrison Gazette 7 May 1900.
     We have much pleasure in publishing the following letter which has just been received from Cpl. Borges, Military Foot Police, lately stationed in Malta, by Police constable T Martin of the Malta Civil Police, doing duty in Sliema.
11th Brigade Staff.
Natal Field Force, Surprise Hill,
Sunday, April 1st 1900.

Dear Tom,
     Just a few lines to you, as I have been thinking you would like to know how we have been getting on since we left Malta.   Well, we had a splendid voyage to Durban, calling at Cyprus, through the Canal to Aden and then to Zanzibar, where we went on shore for a couple of hours, and then proceeded on to Durban where we landed on the 14th December, and entrained for Pietermaritzburgh, but the Derbyshire's went on to East London and they are now doing good service in the Orange free State.   We remained at Pietermaritzburgh about a month, whilst our Brigade was being formed at Frere, where we joined on the morning of the 10th January, from which day up to the day we entered Ladysmith, I must say, to use the mildest expression I can, that we have roughed it.    At Springfield they took 4 of us away and attached them to Sir Charles Warren's Staff, viz: Wall, Ford, Simmons and Sinclair, which left us only 5 for the Brigade Staff.   We had a Sergeant but he was too quiet, and we got a lot of humbugging about, doing things we should not do, and what with one thing and another, I wished myself back on Strada Reale, or the Molo Marian again.   But then the circus had not commenced with us then, not until Spion Kop came off, and those were the liveliest 6 days I ever had, what with that and Acton Holmes, and Potgieters Drift, I must say that we all had a lively time, but they were all failures, but I se the English papers put them down as victories, but I don't see where the victories come in, for we had to evacuate the positions after we had taken them.   After that we recrossed the ""Tugela"" and went into camp again where Sir Redvers Buller addressed the troops and told us not to be  downhearted at retiring, as he had found the key to Ladysmith, and that he would open the eyes of the world, but he opened our eyes I can tell yo.   He marches us back to Chievely, we had a couple of days rest, then commenced the final attack on the Colenso Hills, just to the right of the old Colenso battle ground, and for 18 solid days we pounded those hills with Lyddite and then you should have seen the sight of our infantry advancing, it would have done your heart good to see our fellows going up those hills, like to many flies going up a glass window, in face of a most murderous rattle of musketry.   It was wonderful to see them going and not falling, for the enemy must have been firing with their eyes shut, for you would only see one drop here and there, noting to what you might have expected from such a rattle of fire.   Well they advanced over one hill after the other in grand style, it is a pity that they were not ""Kilties"" so that they would be praised up, but they were only men of the Royal Lancaster Regiment and South Lancashire, supported by the York and Lancaster's.   I forgot to tell yo that I was attached to the Lancashire Brigade.
     The Lancashire Fusiliers had been sent to the rear as they had no officers, they had nearly all been hit as Spion Cop, where the regiment suffered terribly, this is the same battalion which was at Malta, where they arrived shortly after the battle of Khartoum.
     Well I go back to my original yarn, the infantry took hill after hill, and each hill was a stronghold.   When at last our fellows got amongst them, then didn't they fly, they fairly went mad, and I went mad.   I was just behind the Howitzer Battery, and the Officer Commanding commenced turning ""cart wheels.""   The 16 Company, Southern Division RA, (siege battery0 from Malta, stopped firing and commenced cheering, which was taken up by all the batteries, naval and military, shortly after, we got the news that our mounted Infantry had with the Colonial troops entered Ladysmith, but we could not get through on account of the relief convoy having to go first, for there were 16 miles of convoy to go over the river, and only one wagon at a time could cross the pontoon, so it took them nearly 2 days to get over - but I went through with the Staff wagon and entered Ladysmith on the 2nd February.   We had a triumphal entry by the beleaguered troops, but poor fellows they did show it, there was one thing, they were near compared to us, for the relieving force were in rags, and very dirty looking, for we had bee night after night in the trenches without even our coats, and it is bitter cold towards morning I can tell you.
     Of course you know we do not as Policemen, take any active part in the fighting, but are chiefly used as Orderlies to the General.   We have been very unlucky with our Generals.   One of our Generals (Woodgate) got hit at Spion Kop and has since died - and the Brigade Major was killed there - the ADC wounded, Corporal Humphries was wounded also, you knew Humphries, I suppose he was over the Valetta side, and we had another Sergeant hit, and a Corporal killed of the Mounted Police, but the hottest corner I was ever in was at Spion Kop, we were right up with the General and Staff, but I dropped lucky, I was sent to the rear on the fourth day, to look after the wagons, but thank God I am here in the best of health and spirits, and glad to say but three are in hospital.   Ford and Coulter are very bad with enteric fever, and Rhodes is in hospital with a sprained ankle.   Well Tom, after we relieved Ladysmith we thought we were in for a rest, but no, we had not been there 3 days before we were ordered down to Durban, to embark for Port Elizabeth, to join Lord Roberts command but we were stopped at Pietermaritzburg, the order was cancelled, so we came back here again, and are now encamped at the foot of the renowned Surprise Hill.
     Now dear Tom, I don't think I have much more to say at present, only tell all the chaps I wish to be kindly remembered to them and hope you are all quite well.   Sinclair wished to be specially remembered to you, I must say he has gone much thinner, remember me kindly to your wife and family hoping they are quite well.
     I will now conclude.   Excuse me for writing in black lead, but I think I will be able to manage ink for the envelope.   Oh, I forgot, remember to to Paolo and Boneachie, and don's forget to remember me to Sergeant Morealle at St. Julian,s for he was a jolly fine fellow, non once more I will make an attempt to finish this letter, so I will conclude by sending you my best wishes for your welfare, and good luck to you and yours.

Extract from the Police Review, page 318, 2/7/1915.
MILITARY POLICE ON ACTIVE SERVICE.
     The group portrait which appears on this page represent a detachment of Policemen who are with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.   The portrait has been sent to us by PC Horace Giles, of Great Grimsby who is now a Corporal in the Military Foot Police.
     PC Giles, who wrote in the middle of March says:  ""Corporal Biss and myself came out and have been together ever since.   I am pleased to say we get along together A1.   He, of course belongs to Newport Borough, and I, as you know Grimsby Borough.   I am so glad that our Force hods such a fine record.   It want a bit of beating for recruiting considering its size.   I am also glad to say that I got my parcel all right from our worthy Chief Constable, Officers and men, which I can assure you came in very hand.   I should love to see a bit of snow here, but there, never mind, let us all hope for the best and trust that I shall able to return some day and settle down to duty again.   I am sure that it is most kind of our Chief to look after us, and I can only wish him good health an long life.""
     In another letter PC Giles thanks us for sending him some copies of ""On and off duty,"" and a little book called ""On the March.""   He says: ""I am on the desert, and find it very lonesome at times.   The heat and flies do bit so that it takes all our time to brush them away.   I hope that this year will bring forth an honourable peace and so we can settle down again to our old duties.   I find it somewhat more difficult than in peace time, but we must hope for the best..   PC Giles encloses with his letter a smaller portrait group which we are not able to reproduce.   In this is seen Corporal M Creed, of Manchester, Corporal Heath , of Lancashire , and Corporal J Pearce, Metro Police."

Extract from the Belfast Telegraph, 21/11/1958.   Inquest on Cypriot who died after round up.   Bangor man ""hit in self defence""
   Captain John Blakesley (32) of the Royal Military Police told the Coroner at Famagusta today that he struck with his stick, at Andreas Louca, a Greek-Cypriot who later died of head injuries, only in self defence.
     Giving evidence at the inquest on Louca, the officer said he struck at him and at two other Greek Cypriots, when they attacked him as he went to arrest them during a mass search operation after the murder of Mrs Catherine Cutliffe on October 3.
   ""I remember October 3 very well as it was the day two British service wives were shot in Famagusta and one of them died.""
ROUND UP.  "" I was carrying my walking stick.   t was decided to round up all Greek Cypriot youths between the ages of 17 and 27.   I was in charge of an army dog""
     ""I went into the house where the deceased shared a room.   When I went it it was dark and I saw three figures in the gloom.""
     ""They rushed at me and I stuck out at them with my walking stick.   I dealt a backhand blow first and then a forehand blow.   Having done that, I pushed the third individual with the end of my stick
     ""At about the time I struck the first blow, I became aware of a fourth man behind me.   I called out to my dog Timber to help me, and he rushed straight into the room and bit one of the three men.""
     Captain Blakesley said, in reply to questions:  ""It is true I hit every one of the men in the room, but I did not beat them.""Captain Blackesley, from Bangor, Co Down, commanding officer of a military police unit in Famagusta has been in Cyprus for 27 months.   He served previously as an officer in the Grenadier Guards.
     He told the Coroner Mr James Traynor:  ""It was customary in the Brigade of Guards to carry a walking stick at all times.""

Extract from  Western Mail, 4/12/1958.   Troops Used Too Much Force.
During and after arrests which followed the ""ghastly and brutal"" murder of Swansea born Mrs Catherine Cutliffe, a British sergeant's wife in Cyprus, an ""entirely unjustified"" degree of force was used.
   The coroner Mr James Traynor said that at a Famagusta inquest yesterday.
     He said ""One can fully understand the horror, disgust and anger which filled the minds and hearts of everyone that day.   But nothing can justify the assaults on those who were not responsible for the shooting and who had done nothing to warrant such assaults.""
     Blunt Treatment.   Investigating the death of Andreas Louca, 17 years old Greek Cypriot student who was among those rounded up the coroner found that he died from haemorrhage caused by a blow with a blunt instrument which fractured his skull.
     ""But I am unable to conclude when and by whom the blow was struck."" he said.
     He had to rely on the medial evidence and was unable to return a murder verdict.
     Bdr. Brian Cream, of 29th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery (the regiment of the murdered woman's husband) who comes from Swansea, told the coroner he was guard commander at Carsola Camp on October 1.
Bleeding.   He was in charge of detention cages where Cypriots arrested after Mrs Cutliffes killing were placed.
     Cream said ""All Cypriots arrested got out of trucks on arrival unaided.   Some had injuries.   One amongst them was bleeding very badly.   I placed him on the ground within the cage.""
     Cream was then shown a photograph of Louca and asked whether this was the man who was bleeding badly.
     ""This is not the man,"" he replied.
No Beating.   He had seen no one beat the detained Cypriots as they came down from the trucks or as they went into the cage.
     The coroner referred to evidence given by Capt John Blakesley from Bangor, Co. Down, Northern Ireland, commanding officer of the Royal Military Police unit in Famagusta.
     ""Captain Blakesley,"" said the coroner, ""says he struck at two men in that room ""pretty hard.""
Not Sure.   The doctor says the blow that killed the deceased would cause immediate unconsciousness but no witnesses saw him collapse in that room and in fact saw him walk to the truck.
   ""Can I be sure that Capt Blackelsey's blow was in fact the one which killed the deceased?
     ""The answer is clearly no.""

Ref GRO 8041 dated 14/1/19.   
I am suffering from MALARIA.   This I contracted in July 1916, whilst serving with the Salonica Forces.   At the above date I was attached to the 29th Infantry Brigade,. 10 th (Irish) Division, and was engaged on Police Patrol work among the many villages that are situated along the banks of the River STURMA, MACEDONIA.   I reported sick in July, exact date unknown, I was admitted to a Field Ambulance, then evacuated to a C.C.S., and afterwards to the Base Hospital Salonica.   From there to the Tingne Hospital, MALTA.   
From Malta I was evacuated to the U.K. by the Hospital Ship DOVER CASTLE, and landed at Southampton and was sent to the Mill Hill Military Hospital at LIVERPOOL, from which I was discharged on the 9/9/18.
In my opinion the Malarial Fever from which I suffered was caused by the climatic condition under which I had to work.   At the time Malarial Fever was very prevalent among the British Troops and the inhabitants of the district.      Signed F Booker, No. P/1063.  A/S.S.M., MMP.

Mounted Police.
     There has probably been no one more suited to be in charge of the Leeds City Mounted Police than Inspector S K Boyd, who is to retire from that position on 26 October o n the completion of 25 year's service.
     Inspector Boyd was placed on a horse's back when he was little more than a baby and he was only a boy when he joined the 7th Queen's Own Hussars.
     He was the first Leeds policeman to be awarded a prize at the Olympia Horse Show, London.   His five years in France during hostilities were spent with the Military Mounted Police and he was mentioned in despatches.   Along with other Leeds police officers he went to London last year to receive the King's Jubilee Medal.

Oliver Bowes.

Extract from the Sheffield Times 28 November 1914.   FLAMBOROUGH.
    A letter from the Front - Mrs. G. Cross of the Woodbine Cottage, Flamborough, has received a letter from her brother, Oliver Bowes, who went to France at the commencement of the war and is now serving as a Corporal in the Military Mounted Police.   For some years he served in the 12th Lancers in India and also in the 15th Hussars in South Africa.   Corporal Bowes is a son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Bowes, of Kirby Misperton where he was well known.   He says:- ""We have had the hardest fight in the last ten days or fortnight, which has taken place since we came out.   It has been hell, but I am pleased to say that we have held the enemy and driven them back a mile or two.  Because they cannot get the town (I am sending a view of it), they have been shelling that now and almost smashed it up and are not doing us a bit of harm by it.   It is a shame the way it has been destroyed - just for spite!   We suffered but their losses must be awful - mown down like a lot of sheep.   They have to climb over their fallen to get near.   I did not, at first believe half the tales which we hav heard about them, but I do now. 


Extract from the Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette 30 November 1914.
The Kaiser's Bodyguard - Its Fate.
     Corporal Oliver Bowes, of the Military Mounted Police, writing from the front to his sister Mona, who is a maid to Mrs. Welch of 10, Thornhill Terrace, says:-  ""Just a line to let you know tha6t I am in the best of trim.   We are having some lovely weather now, plenty of rain and jolly cold with it to help make it more pleasant.   Makes on think we are in England instead of 'sunny France.'   We had the Kaiser here for two days;  came to see the 'contemptible little army,'  but instead he saw his bodyguard, which he had brought up on purpose to smash us, swiped out.   A lot broke through our front line, but none of them went back again to tell him - our chaps saw to that"".
     ""One of my chums was watering his horse the other day in a ford when his horse gave a jerk and pulled him head over heels into the ford.   if he had been drowning we could not have helped him for laughing.
     The enemy have destroyed the town here and it is a shame, as they are not doing us a bit of harm by it.   The church and town took years to build.   They fire shells weighing 110Ib. into the place, so you can guess what damage they must be doing to a defenceless town.   God help them when the French do get in to Germany; there will be a reckoning!"""

Extract from the Evening Herald (Dublin) 26/6/2003.   Para Deaths 'misunderstanding'
A ""MISUNDERSTANDING"" over weapons searches was today blamed for mob scenes in Iraq on the day six soldiers were killed.
     Major General Peter Wall said the crowd violence that lead to eight Paras being wounded in a firefight seemed ""to have stemmed from a misunderstanding"".
     He offered no explanation for the reported two hour police station siege which left six Royal Military Police soldiers dead, amid claims that four of the men might have been executed with their own guns.
     The senior British commander said he could not comment on the claims while an investigation into Tuesday's shooting was being carried out.
     Reports had claimed that all the violence was triggered by anger of alleged heavy handed weapons searches in and around the southern town of Al Majar al-Kabir."

Extract from the Essex Newsman 3 February 1917.
TWO BRAVE M.M.P.'s.  MILITARY MEDALS PRESENTED AT CHELMSFORD.
     An interesting presentation of Military Medals took place in Admiral's Park, Chelmsford, on Monday, when Brig.-Gen. Daniel pinned the medals upon the tunics of Sergt. J.L. Harper and Cpl. G Buck, both of the Military Mounted Police.   For the ceremony a Battalion was paraded under Lieut.-Col. Wilson, together with a party of the M.M.P. under Squadron Sergeant Major Murfit.   The General who was received with customary salute by the troops and the band, was attended by an A.D.C.   The A.P.M. Capt E. J. Solano and the Mayor of Chelmsford (Ald. J. O. Thompson, J.P. ? also present.)
     General Daniel said he had been asked to present the two medals for bravery in the field - two of the most coveted distinctions a soldier could wear, except the V.C., and he daresay in many cases the men winning those medals for bravery in the field had done just as gallant and good services as those who were wearing the more coveted decorations.   The General then read the official account of the deeds which won the medals as under.   
Sergt. Harper: For gallantry and conspicuous bravery in Gallipoli, saving 109 boxes of ammunition under heavy fire.   he was in command of 109 mules with a Zion Mule Corps.   The drivers ran away and this NCO worked with two men and saved the ammunition.
Corporal Buck:  This N.C.O. and another were on duty near Bellevue Farm, Albert, on July 19, at cross-roads important to traffic, the post was heavily shelled.   About 4 p.m. a shell exploded a bomb store.   The above mentioned N.C.O., despite the continuous shelling of the road near the post and the explosions of bombs, succeeded in diverting the traffic and regulating it without accident, casualty or congestion, they also cleared the road of unexploded bombs, which might have caused injury.
     General Daniel shook both men by the hand, congratulated them upon their valour and expressed the hope that they would live many years to wear the medals."

Fight With A Madman.
     A desperate fight with a madman who defied four policemen and a number of civilians for two hour, was described at an inquest at Redhill.
     William Alfred Buckland, age forty five, a pensioned sergeant major, who lived with his mother, lost his reason.   The police were called, and Police Inspector Hood, with a sergeant and two constables, went to the house.
     Sergeant Bacon stated that Buckland was inside with a steel spike four feet long.
     ""He raved at us and threatened us."" said the sergeant, ""and after we tried for two hours to induce him to open the door he allowed his sister to enter.   He then put his back to the wall and glared at the police.
     ""I suddenly leaped on the madman.   I received a terrific blow on the mouth, and inspector hood's finger was broken in the struggle.   Buckland was overpowered eventually and taken away.
     It was found that death was caused by exhaustion, following acute delerium and fatty degeneration of the heart.

Struggle With A Madman.
Midnight Scene At Redhill.
     A sad story of the end of a Redhill man who lost his reason and was taken to Netherne Asylum, where he died, was told at an inquest conducted on Wednesday by Mr. F J Nightingale, at the Institution.   The deceased was William Alfred Buckland, age 45, living with his sister, Mrs Allcorn at Monson Road Redhill, and was an Army pensioner.   He was a native of Redhill, and before joining the Army twenty four years ago was a valet.   He served in the Egyptian Campaign, the Boer War, and the Great War, and retired six months ago with the rank of Sergt.-Major in the Military Police, with a well earned pension.   He was the possessor of seven medals.
     Jessie Allcorn, the sister, who gave evidence of identification, stated on Thursday, the 28th inst, her brother complained of a headache.   Later he complained of his throat, and on the 39th Dr Crichton ws sent for.   he could not sleep and got worse.   On Tuesday last week he was light-headed and on Wednesday he was seen again by the doctor.   in the evening he was taken to the Guardian Institution by the Police and later removed to the Netherne.
     Police-Sergt. Bacon said on Wednesday about 10pm he received information at the Police Station that a man had gone mad and that he was running about Linkfield Lane,   Witness went to Linkfield Lane and heard that Buckland had returned to his home, 56, Monson road.   He found the deceased there, and the door locked.   He could see him in one of the rooms downstairs, his aged mother being upstairs,   Witness had with him other officers and for two hours he tried to persuade Buckland to open the door.   he had a weapon in his hand four feet long with a steel spike at the end of it, with which he threatened to brain the first man who entered the house.   The only garments he had on were a pair of running shorts and a jersey.   He was not wearing any boots.   After a long time he persuaded the deceased to open the door and allow his sister to come in and rest.   Deceased then placed himself against the wall and raved at witness.   He parleyed with him for a time and getting within a few feet of him he pounced on the weapon.   Buckland struck him a terrific blow on the jaw and there was a struggle.   Inspector Hood had his finger broken.
     The Coroner: You had a struggle.   Inspector hood had his finger broken.
     The Coroner: You had a struggle? - Yes, he was a powerful man and having little clothing on it was difficult to take hold of him.   Continuing, witness said they got him to the Guardians' Institution, where he was placed in the padded room and given a sleeping draught by the doctor.   In the struggle they forced him on to the head of a couch, where they secured him.   The Coroner: There was a big struggle going on? - Yes, and it is not surprising he had a number of bruises on the trunk and limbs? - No.
     And it is not surprising he had a number of bruises on the trunk and limbs? - No.
     Do you know anything about a dislocation of a toe? - No.   He was running about without any shoes on.
     From what you say you were two hours with him and I take it there was no more violence used than was necessary?- I think his relatives will bear out what I say.   I think they were pleased with the way we treated him.
     Mrs Allcorn: Oh. yes; we are satisfied.
Man With Abnormal Ribs.
     Charles Allcorn, of Monson road who is also related to the deceased, said he saw what happened on Wednesday night.   Before the police came deceased struggled with his sister.   The police did the best they could for deceased and showed great patience.
     The Coroner: I may take it there was no more violence used than was necessary:- That is so.   I am sure of that.
     Mr J H Marsh, relieving officer, said he removed deceased to Netherne under a Magistrates order on Friday.   He was delirious, noisy and resistive.   With the assistance of PC Miles and two officers of the Guardians' Institution, deceased was placed in the motor ambulance and for his own protection and  the protection of others he was handcuffed.
     Alfred She attendant at Netherne said Buckland had been very violent and injections were given.   There was no mechanical restraint used at all.
     Dr. J Calving Lister, assistant medical officer at the Institution said he saw deceased on his admission.   Deceased was handcuffed and he had him removed immediately to the bathroom for examination.   He became very violent, clutching at witness and the attendants.   He was transferred to a bed and still being very violent was given a sedative which quietened him.   When he got over it he was again violent.   He was only quiet after a sedative, being violent half an hour before he died.   He made a post-mortem and found bruises on the arms and chest which might have been caused in the struggle.   They were superficial bruises and some of them were pretty extensive.   He did not find any fractured ribs, but the ninth and tenth ribs, instead of being attached to the chest-bone, were free.   They were floating ribs.   The eleventh and twelfth were quite abnormal ribs.   The bruising was what might have been expected after the struggle.
     The Coroner: In your opinion had the injuries anything to do with death:- Nothing.   The cause of death was exhaustion due to acute delirium and fatty degeneration of the heart.
     The Coroner said certain injuries on the body were discovered, but they were such injuries that might have bee expected after the struggle.   The sister and brother in law were satisfied that the police were patient and all they did was to restrain him in such a manner as was warranted.   The same regards applied to the attendants at the Guardians Institution and the attendants in Netherne.   He returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence."

     Quartermaster G Broackes, the recently appointed Assistant Provost Marshal at the Curragh, leaves Aldershot on the 30th inst, and takes up his duties on the 1st April.   It may be interesting to our readers to know that Quartermaster Broackes served 19 years in the 4th Dragoon Guards, out of which time he was a non-commissioned officer 18 years.   He jointed the Military Mounted Police in 1974 in which he served two years as sergeant 1st assistant at the Curragh, and during the last wo years he had the entire charge.   He was appointed Sergeant Major on the Mounded Police being formed into a distinct corps in 1877, and cam to Aldershot in 1978, where he has since been stationed.   During his sojourn here Quartermaster Broackes has by his courteous and general demeanour made many friends, both military and civilian by whom his departure from amongst the will be greatly regretted.   The admirable manner in which Quartermaster Broackes has performed his duties at Aldershot has given his superior officers every satisfaction, they having frequently spoken in praise of him.   Quartermaster Broackes is succeeded by Sergeant McKerr, late Scots Greys, who has been appointed Sergeant Major.   Sergeant Major McKerr has been for a great many years a sergeant in the Military Mounted Police, during which time he has gained the respect of those in authority over him"

Extract from the Birmingham Daily Post, 5/4/1958.   Death Penalty for Terrorism Back in Cyprus.
Two More Soldiers Killed.
The death penalty became mandatory for all terrorist offences in Cyprus after two British soldiers had been murdered in Famagusta yesterday.
     New emergency regulations were hurried through last night, giving judges no option but to pass the death sentence on anyone carrying or being in possession of firearms and bombs.
     The Governor Sir Hugh Foot acted swiftly as British troops took over full control of Famagusta where the two soldiers were shot down in a street full of people taking a Sunday stroll.
     His political and military advisers agreed to reintroduce the mandatory death penalties first established by the former Governor, Sir John Harding and lifted when tension eased after the EOKA truce last year.
Dragnet Operation.
     The murder of the two men who were members of the Royal Military Police was followed by the biggest dragnet operation since the outbreak began in the island.   They were on duty in plain clothes, patrolling a part of the Greek quarter normally out of bounds to British troops.
     The murders yesterday - which brings to 106 the total of British killed since the emergency - were he first since the expiring on April 28 of an EOKA terrorist ultimatum that reprisals would be taken against Britons would be resumed unless allegedly ""inhuman measures"" in British detention camps were stopped.
     The Governor will return to London this week for new talks on the island's future.

Extract from the Western Mail, 5/5/1958.   Sir Hugh brings back death law.
     Two British soldiers were shot dead among strolling afternoon crowds in Famagusta yesterday - and immediately the Governor of Cyprus, Sir Hugh Foot, brought back the tough emergency regulations first established by his predecessor, Sir John Harding.
     The death penalty became mandatory for all terrorist offences.   Judges have no option but to pass the death sentence on anyone carrying or possessing firearms and bombs.
     Sir Hugh acted swiftly as troops took over full control of the city where the soldiers were shot and began the biggest dragnet operation in three years.
     His political and military advisers agreed to reintroduce the mandatory death penalty which were lifted when tension eased on the island after the EOKA truce last year.
Fired Back
    The soldiers, in plain clothes but on duty, were patrolling a part of the Greek quarter, normally out of bounds to British troops.
     They were Lance Corporal B F Turvey of Cambourne Avenue, Harold Hill, Romford Essex, and Lance Corporal W N Cameron of Lawrence Drive, Leven, Fifeshire both members of the Royal Military Police.
     One of the soldiers crumpled on the pavement at the first blast which hit him in the back.   His companion managed to turn, pull out a revolver and fire a shot before he, too, was hit.
Searched
     Troops immediately swooped on the area and arrested every Greek Cypriot youth in sight.   Official reports said the number held for questioning was ""between 300 and 400.""   Greek Cypriot sources claimed it was as many as 600.
     Greek flags displayed on some buildings were ripped down by troops while large scale searches of houses in the area were carried out.
     A security forces spokesman said: ""It is believed the gunmen knew who they were shooting.   The killing follows the pattern of previous EOKA murders.""
     The shooting came only 24 hours after an official announcement that the Governor intended to fly to London early this week for talks with the British government on the future of Cyprus.
     In a broadcast statement last month he said his London trip would depend on whether violence continued.
     The murders were the first since the expiry, on April 23, of an EOKA terrorist ultimatum which said reprisals against Britons would be resumed unless ""inhuman measures"" in British detention camps were stopped.

Extract from the Chichester Observer, 21/11/1923.   Another Military Funeral.
The third military funeral within a few weeks took place at Chichester on Saturday afternoon.   Deceased was Mr Thomas Charlesworth, age 47, of 5 Tower Street.   He had a fine record of service extending over 22 years, most of which was spent in the Military Foot Police in which he ultimately rose to the rank of first class warrant officer.   He served during the Boer War, during which he contracted double pneumonia, in addition to being wounded, and had to be invalided home.   He also fought throughout the Great War, going out with the expeditionary force in August  of 1914.   He gained the Mons Star, with the distinctive small ""rose"" to indicate he had taken part in the first battle of Mons, and he was also awarded a medal for meritorious conduct, as a result of being mentioned in  despatches for gallantry in the Field.   He also had the medal for Long Service & Good Conduct, and the Queen Victoria medal, in recognition of his Boer War service.   As a result of his war experiences, he suffered from a paralysis of the brain, which was the ultimate cause of his death, which occurred the previous Wednesday.

Futile Gallop For A Doctor.

He says:-  "" I was withing twenty yards of him when it happened.   The King's horse reared up and came over with him.   The horse started kicking when the King was on the ground.   Several staff officers ran to his assistance, got the horse off him, picked the king up and then laid him down.   One of the staff officers then ran up to me and said, ""Go and find a doctor - go like hell-in-the-night!""   I galloped for about two miles but could not find a doctor anywhere;  so I returned and reported that I could not find one.   They then picked the King up and put him in his motor-car.   he was lying about for more than ten minutes, so I think he was hurt rather seriously.

     On several occasions the King visited the front in France and during one of these on October 28 1915, met with a severe accident.   His horse slipped an rolled on him, causing severe contusions which laid him up for several weeks.   He returned to England in a hospital ship and could not resume fork till December 12.
     In a letter received by Mr John Clark, Malmesbury, from his son Corporal Fred Clark, of the Mounted Military Police the latter described his futile gallop for a couple of miles, in search of a doctor for the King when his Majesty's accident occurred.
     ""The King was out here on Thursday inspecting troops just behind the firing line.   When he had finished the men gave a cheer and the King's horse reared up and cam over with him.   The horse stated kicking when the Kin was on the ground,   Several staff officers ran to his assistance, got the horse off him, picked the King up and then laid him down.

     He offered no explanation for the reported two hour police station siege which left six Royal Military Police soldiers dead, amid claims that four of the men might have been executed with their own guns.
     The senior British commander said he could not comment on the claims while an investigation into Tuesday's shooting was being carried out.

MILITARY POLICE - RECORD OF MEDAL PRESENTATION.
     We had pleasure in our last issue in reporting a record parade for the presentation of medals for long service and good conduct, this taking place in the Army Service Corps, when fourteen members of that Corps were so decorated.   Now we have pleasure in placing on record an even more remarkable record, which the members of the Military Police have achieved for no fewer than 20 non-commissioned officers of that corps at one time.   The record is the more remarkable from the fact that the whole strength of the Corps is no more than 500, of whom a good proportion are already in possession of the same devotion.   The following are the names of those who have been the latest recipients of the medal :- Sergeant J Cook, 367, Sergeant. C H Dale, 377, Sergeant A Burrill, 407, Sergeant E Baldwin, 414, Sergeant F West, 419,  Corporal J Savage, 368, Lance Corporal H W Freeman, 501, Lance Corporal W Thorndyke, 522, Lance Corporal J H Salter, 633, Lance Corporal J Finch, 629, Military Mounted Police;  Sergeant W Barrett,494, Sergeant W Howard, 501, Sergeant W Vernon, 502, Sergeant W Weaver, 503, Sergeant J Alder, 529 and Sergeant E A Siddle, 597, Corporal A E Alliston, 596, Lance Corporal H E Richardson, 861, Lance Corporal R L Handley, 675, Lancer Corporal A H Downton, 990, Military Foot Police.

Extract from the Blackpool Gazette & Herald 29 October 1915.
     In consequence of a large number of members of the Blackpool Police Force having applied to the Chief Constable for permission to join the Army to do duty as military foot police, the Watch Committee held a special meeting at the Town Hall, on Tuesday, and sanctioned the enlistment of fifteen men.   These are Police Constables Jno. McHale, No. not found), Herbert Smith (P/2301), Albert Richmond (P/2306), George Murry, (No. not found), Alfred Kerfoot (P/2311), John A Cooper (P/2307), Granville Hallworth (P/2309), William Shenty (P/2313), Christopher W Pattinson (P/2304), Alexander Fletcher (P/2302), Joseph Noble (P/2308), William Carew (P/2312), John Talbot (P/2303), Thomas Dalton (P/2310) and William T Clayton.
     The Watch Committee met the men generously.   They decided to grant to the wife and children of a soldier or sailor policeman, or, if he was unmarried, to his dependents, an allowance from the police funds within the limits, and subject to the conditions specified in the Police Reservists (Allowances) Act, 1914.   The service rendered by constables in the army or navy who return to the police force will be reckoned as ordinary service for purposes of police pensions.   In the case of men who die, or are disabled whilst on military or naval service, the Court decided to supplement and pension granted from Imperial funds, up to the limit specified in  Section 1 of the Police Constables (Naval and Military Service) Act, 1914.
The men enlisted are now having a short leave, and they will journey to Aldershot on Monday next.   There are now 32 Blackpool constables in his Majesty's forces.   We understand that several more applications are being made for sanction to enlist.

Obituary - With regret we have to record the death of Lance Corporal Edwin Capell.   This young man was only 24 years of age, and promised to do well in his work.   he was engaged a Corporal of military Foot Police, and as such, was present at the Battle of Colenso, being part of General Buller's body-guard.   During the later part of the action he witnessed the loss of the guns, and also saw Lord Robert's son shot whilst attempting to save them.

Extract from the Sheffield Independent .   23/12/1918.   Fate of Eight Spied.   One Hanged and Seven Shot at the Tower.
In the possession of a sergeant major of the British Military Foot Police is a peculiarly made leather strap with which German spies, caught in this country and condemned to death, were fastened in a special chair at the Tower of London prior to being shot.
     There were a great many spies in England both before and after the war, acting on behalf of the Kaiser.   Most of them were neutrals, and came originally from South American States.   Nearly all of them attempted to forward their information by post.   But thanks tot he astuteness of the Censor's staff it was rarely these letters, even although written in invisible ink, went undetected.   The British Secret Service, ever considerate, allowed them to send and receive letters and collect information, but it reserved the privilege  of opening the correspondence both ways and making alterations likely to be of more use to the Allied than German.
     Eight German spies were executed in this country.   after the secret trial and condemnation to death the spy was taken to the Tower, there to await the dread summons in the early hours of the morning.   Taken fro his cell by a party of military police the spy was strapped to a chair in a quadrangle of the Tower.   There, facing him, about 10 paces distant, was a party, usually eight men, from the battalion of Guards on duty at the time.
     The preliminaries were soon arranged.   The spy was placed in the chair and his body and limbs were tightly strapped to it.   Then his chest was bared to receive the bullets.
     Some of the spies took their execution stoically;  others, again made a last despairing fight and went to their death shrieking and cursing their Maker.   One of these, latter was a man called Muller, who was arrested while acting as a waiter in an hotel at Blackpool.   During his incarceration in the Tower Muller broke down completely, and was carried out struggling and shouting, cursing himself for his stupidity and reviling the grim little part in the quadrangle.
     One spy was hanged at Wormwood Scrubs Prison;  other seven were shot.   The hanging cost about 20 and coming to the conclusion that it would be just as effective, to say nothing of considerably cheaper, it was decided to shoot all spies at the Tower.
     The female spies, like the men, succeeded in getting comparatively little information of value out of the country.   Most of them, neither young nor beautiful like the spy of the story writers are languishing behind prison walls and will remain there for some years to come.

Extract from the Sunday Post.   5/6/1921.   Advert for the Weekly News.   Secrets of the Tower, My experiences with condemned Spies.   By Sergeant-Major G J Ford.
Sergeant Major Ford was the senior non commissioned officer of the Military Police in the London District during the war, and in that capacity he was charged with the responsibility of executing captured German spies to and from their place of trial, and when they had been found guilty from their prison to the Tower of London, where he had to supervise the arrangements for their execution.   Sergeant Major Ford had some extraordinary experiences with the spies who went to the fatal chair.
     n this weeks issue of the ""Weekly News"" he deals with the spies, Janssen and Roos, who were within the space of a few minutes.   There were extraordinary last minute scenes   Janssen pacing up and down, pacing up and down his cell, calmly smoking a cigarette, the time he knew his accomplice was in the fatal chair.     Article has as small picture of Sergeant Major Ford  and Robert Rosenthal executed for espionage."

Extract from the Aldershot News 9 January 1942.
MR W J P GODLEY
     The many friends of Mr William John Parsons Godley, of 1, Queens Road, Aldershot heard with regret of his death, which took place suddenly on Tuesday.   He was 69 years of age.   Born at Harwich, he joined the Essex Regiment when he was 18 years old, and later transferred to the Military Foot Police, in which he served until 1914.   He saw service in the South African War.  Rejoining on the outbreak of war in 1914, he served with the Corps until 1919.   On demobilization he was appointed a park keeper at Regent's Park, and continued in that appointment until he retired on reaching the age of 65 years.   ""Bill"" Godley was a keen supporter of the Aldershot Football Club, and for many years did duty on the ""players' and Officials'"" gate at the Recreation Ground, when ever Aldershot were playing at home.   He leaves a widow and one daughter.

Corporal T Laffan of the Military Foot Police.   An enthusiastic reception was also accorded to Corporal Thomas Laffan, of the Military Foot Police attached to the West Yorkshire Regiment, who detrained at Barracks Station on Saturday night, having come on by the same train from Netley as Pte Coughlan and Pte Flynn.   Besides a large crowd, he was awaited at the station by the Catholic Brass Band, which played several martial airs.   Corporal Laffan went out to South Africa on October 20th, and arrived in Cape Town on the day the date of which, he jovially remarked "" I cannot easily forget, November 10th, my birthday.""   He was with General Hilyard's column, being orderly to Colonel, now General Kitchener.   Speaking with a representative of the express yesterday morning, The Corporal said he received his baptism of fire at Willow Grange, where, he said ""I fought in sopping wet clothes.""   Other battles in which he participated were Colenso, Spion Kop, and Vaal Krantz, being at the relief of Ladysmith.   ""At Elandslaagte, "" he remarked , had a hard experience of breakfast shots.   We were getting ready for breakfast hen the Boers opened fire, and we had to form up for one of attack without a morsel in our stomachs.""   A fragment of shell, he added, came tight through their tent, and fell in the middle of the place.   He was along with others who escorted the Boer prisoners down to Pietermaritzburg, where they handed them over to the Natal authorities.   Speaking of the Relief of Ladysmith, he said they were fully repaid for their hardships and fighting by seeing the joy with which the relief force was received by the besieged people.   At Spion Kop Cpl. Laffan, who of most genial disposition, received a bullet wound in the breast.   Instead of being reported wounded, singular to say, he was stated to have been killed at Spion Kop... He is in possession of several curios, amongst which is the watch which belonged to the Boer commander, Pretorious.
Cpl Laffan can congratulate himself that he is one of the privileged few who have read the reports of their own demise in the newspaper.   He is, in this respect, in the very excellent company of Lord Brougham, and Sgt Simon, MP and one or two other notabilities.   It is a decided advantage to read your own biography, which also few of us will have the opportunity of perusing.

MILITARY POLICE - RECORD OF MEDAL PRESENTATION.
     We had pleasure in our last issue in reporting a record parade for the presentation of medals for long service and good conduct, this taking place in the Army Service Corps, when fourteen members of that Corps were so decorated.   Now we have pleasure in placing on record an even more remarkable record, which the members of the Military Police have achieved for no fewer than 20 non-commissioned officers of that corps at one time.   The record is the more remarkable from the fact that the whole strength of the Corps is no more than 500, of whom a good proportion are already in possession of the same devotion.   The following are the names of those who have been the latest recipients of the medal :- Sergeant J Cook, 367, Sergeant.

Extract from the Hull Daily Mail, 25/4/1947.   LONE GUNMAN WAS TOUGHEST CASE FOR HULL 'REDCAP'
     One of the first military policemen to be mentioned in dispatches in the war, a Hull ""redcap"" has just finished a long tour of duty in Berlin where he has chased murderers, bought black marketeers and generally kept the peace.
     He is CQMS R (Tiny) Coulson, Corps of Royal Military Police of 52, Ryehill Grove, East Hull Estate, now serving with 5 Divisional Provost Company.
     In his first five months in Berlin, CQMS Coulson handled five murder cases, and three times was held up at the point of a pistol.
     ""For one month I did nothing else but raid notorious hotels and cafes for black market operators, and caught quite a few,"" he said when interviewed.
      ""One tough case I remember was then we spent six months searching for a notorious murderer and looter.   He was efficient and worked alone.   His system was simple.   He walked into a shop, shot the counter assistants dead and walked off with everything he could see.   But he made a slip for which he later paid with his life.
WITH THE ""DESERT RATS""
     CQMS Coulson jointed the Army in 1930 and became a ""redcap"" a month before the war.   He went to France in 1939, served throughout the campaign and left from Dunkirk.   In 1941 he went to Egypt and crossed Africa with the 8th Army.   He went to Italy with the 7th Armoured ""Desert Rats"" Division and served with them throughout France, where he landed on D Day, Belgium, Holland and Germany.   He took part in the march to Berlin."

Extract from the Aberdeen Evening Explorer, 1/3/1971.   Fire bomb fury kills soldier.
A young redcap NCO died in a Londonderry hospital today shortly after a petrol bomb attack set his Land Rover ablaze.
     A boy of 16 who may have been a sniper is in hospital in Belfast with gun shot stomach wounds.   Just before he was injured troops had returned fire in Omar street on the Falls Road.
     The Lance corporal in the Royal Military Police was fatally injured in the north east corner of Bogside, Londonderry, when the Land Rover was attacked with petrol bombs as it passed the corner of Westland and Cable street on a routine patrol.
     The vehicle was confronted by a youth who threw what looked like a petrol bomb which did not explode.   At the same time 15 to 20 youths converged from both sides on the vehicle and threw 10 petrol bombs all of which exploded - four against the vehicle and the rest on the road.
     The vehicle mounted the pavement and struck a wall.   the driver got out and fell to the ground, as he did so.
Stoned.
     He picked himself up and went back towards the vehicle but could not get near it because of the flames.   He was stoned by the crowd of youths but charged them and arrested one before running to a police station while he was being stoned.
     The injured soldier was extracted from the back of the Land Rover by residents of the street and was taken into a house and wrapped in blankets.
     The third member of the patrol who was in front of the vehicle was also taken care of by the people in the street.
     An ambulance took the injured soldier to Altnagelvin Hospital where he died shortly afterwards.
     An Army spokesman said 30 or 40 residents of the area were thoroughly helpful when the vehicle was being recovered.
     It was an isolated incident and Londonderry otherwise had a quiet weekend."

MILITARY POLICE PRESENTATION.
     On Monday evening a presentation was made at the Star, Wellington Street, to Sergeant G Todd, who was leaving the Military Foot Police after 21 years service in the army.   Of these years 15 have been spent in the Military foot Police and the last 12 moths at Woolwich.
     Provost Sergeant Creswell presided and in making the presentation, said the he was very sorry to lose Sergeant Todd, who has given every satisfaction in the performance of his duties at Woolwich.   he explained that there was a rule in the Military Foot Police which prevented Sergeant Todd from remaining after 21years service, the rule being made in the interests of a more rapid promotion.   He handed to the Sergeant a handsome marble clock and two bronze ornaments, which had been subscribed for by his comrades and friends in the town.   A brooch for Mrs Todd was present.
     Sergeant Todd acknowledging expressed his pleasure at finding that the Military Foot Police were so well treated at Woolwich.   His experience here was a contrast to that in some other garrisons.
    Several of those present, military and civilian contributed songs and a very pleasant evening was spent."

MILITARY POLICE - RECORD OF MEDAL PRESENTATION.
     We had pleasure in our last issue in reporting a record parade for the presentation of medals for long service and good conduct, this taking place in the Army Service Corps, when fourteen members of that Corps were so decorated.   Now we have pleasure in placing on record an even more remarkable record, which the members of the Military Police have achieved for no fewer than 20 non-commissioned officers of that corps at one time.   The record is the more remarkable from the fact that the whole strength of the Corps is no more than 500, of whom a good proportion are already in possession of the same devotion.   The following are the names of those who have been the latest recipients of the medal :- Sergeant J Cook, 367, Sergeant.

In Unlawful Possession.
     Richard Stott Adams, of Durrington , was brought up in custody and charged with being found in the unlawful possession of certain regimental necessaries, to wit, six horse-shoes at Durrington, on 25th April.   Defendant said he was guilty of having the horse-shoes in his possession but he did not know to whom they belonged. - P. S. Scott stated that on the previous Wednesday he visited the Stonehenge Inn and went in to the stables, part of which were occupied by the prisoner and there he found in a lock-up wooden trunk, six military horseshoes.   When charged Adams replied: ""I had them given to me but I didn't know whose they were.""  In answer to the prisoner the witness agreed that the lock up box was not locked:  everything was open.   Sergeant Dale, of the Military Mounted Police, corroborated the Farrier Quartermaster Sergeant Jefferys identified the shoes as Government property.   In defence Adams stated that the Horseshoes were left in the stables by the man who occupied them before He (prisoner) went into them.   He kept them in the stables thinking there was no harm in it.   Supt. Longstone handed a book up to the magistrates remarking  There is a list of other offences which shows the character of the man.   The Bench imposed a fine of ""s including costs.   Defendant shed a few tears and paid the money.

MILITARY POLICE - RECORD OF MEDAL PRESENTATION.
     We had pleasure in our last issue in reporting a record parade for the presentation of medals for long service and good conduct, this taking place in the Army Service Corps, when fourteen members of that Corps were so decorated.   Now we have pleasure in placing on record an even more remarkable record, which the members of the Military Police have achieved for no fewer than 20 non-commissioned officers of that corps at one time.   The record is the more remarkable from the fact that the whole strength of the Corps is no more than 500, of whom a good proportion are already in possession of the same devotion.   The following are the names of those who have been the latest recipients of the medal :- Sergeant J Cook,367, Sergeant. C H Dale, 377, Sergeant A Burrill, 407, Sergeant E Baldwin, 414, Sergeant F West, 419,  Corporal J Savage, 368, Lance Corporal H W Freeman, 501, Lance Corporal W Thorndyke, 522, Lance Corporal J H Salter, 633, Lance Corporal J Finch, 629, Military Mounted Police;  Sergeant W Barrett,494, Sergeant W Howard, 501, Sergeant W Vernon, 502, Sergeant W Weaver, 503, Sergeant J Alder, 529 and Sergeant E A Siddle, 597, Corporal A E Alliston, 596, Lance Corporal H E Richardson, 861, Lance Corporal R L Handley, 675, Lancer Corporal A H Downton, 990, Military Foot Police.

Extract from the Folkestone, Hythe, Sandgate & Cheriton Herald 20 July, 1912.   A CHASE ON THE RANGES.
     John Godsell, Charles Ralph, Harold Middleton, and Geo. Stapley, were summoned for trespassing upon the Hythe ranges in search of conies.
     Geo. Arthur Day, of the Military Mounted Police, stated that at about 08.40 pm. on June 28th, he was in the vicinity of 'N' range and saw the defendants and three other men on War Department land.   A number of dogs were with them and the men were searching the ground for game.   On the approach of witness they all bolted.   He galloped after Goodsell and Ralph and also Middleton (who gave witness the name of Williams).   Witness told them they would be reported.   The defendant Stapley got away from witness, but he was subsequently recognised by the range warden.   The men were frequently on the ranges and were well known by the School of Musketry employees.
     In answer to Goodsell, witness stated that the ranges were not open to the public.
     Stapley denied that he was on the ranges then or or at any other time.
     In answer to the Bench, the witness said the defendants had not nets with them.
     Chas. Kent of the Military Police, corroborated generally, but he could not recognise Stapley as being the man who got away.
     John B. Wilson, range warden, said that he saw the military policeman galloping along and realised that there was something wrong,  he himself ran to the Reach Field and there met the defendants Goodsell and Ralph.   He afterwards saw Stapley; witness knew them well.
     Ralph declared that there were two rights on way across the ranges and that when the Town Council sold the land to the War Office, they did so on  the understanding that those rights of way should be allowed to exist.
     The Chairman said there was not sufficient evidence to shown that the men were on the ranges for an unlawful purpose.   The question of trespassing did not concern the Bench;  that was for the School of Musketry.   The case against the men would therefore be dismissed.

Extract from the Nottingham Journal 28 January 1915.
PLEASANT SURPRISE.   - Mounted Constable's Gift from Nottingham Lady in America.
     A Nottingham soldier's pleasant surprise is told in a letter received by Mrs. Dunkerley, of 5c, Alberta Terrace, Sherwood Rise, from her husband Corporal Joseph Dunkerley, who until the outbreak of the war was a mounted constable in the Nottingham City Police Force, stationed at Hyson Green and formerly at Carrington.
     He says that a short while ago he, in company with many other British soldiers, received a parcel of comforts from friends and sympathisers in America.   In his case it was the more welcome because a parcel sent from home had not been delivered to him.   Putting on a pair of socks included in the parcel he found a message written on each side of a small piece of paper.   On one side it read:-  To Tommy Atkins. - May God bless and keep you is the prayer of the maker. - Mrs G. R. Sharp, Wichita, Kansas, U.S.A.   On the other the writer added:- I am an Englishwoman who left Nottingham eight years ago.
Dunkerley has asked his wife to write a letter of thanks for Mrs. Sharp, to tell her that by strange coincidence her gift fell into the hands of a Nottingham man.
     The ex-police officer encloses the message in his letter, together with a snapshot of himself and another trooper on horseback.   He states that he has made friends with a French policeman.
     A previous photograph taken at St. Nazaire, accompanied a previous letter.   This is not Dunkerleys first experience of war, for he fought through the South African war.   He left Nottingham in August as a reservist in the 17 Hussars.   He has since attained the rank of Corporal at present attached to the Military Mounted Police.

On the placid water of the Worther See, famous Austrian beauty spot where the Duke of Windsor is reputed to have stayed, members of the corps of Militry Police are manning a lake water patrol and enjoying every minute of their novel ""tour of duty.""   Among them is Cpl Greville Dunnett of 5 Westbrook road, Margate.   The Worther See, a lake 14 miles long ant two miles across at its widest point is perfectly suited for boating, fishing, swimming, surfing, diving and sailing.   The amphibious policing of the Worther See has proved not only a very necessary innovation to the interest of all ranks who enjoy the lake's many recreational facilities but has enabled members of the CMP to enjoy well merited relaxation from their normally arduous duties.   The Provost engaged in the job rendered faithful services throughout the Italian campaign, particularly from the crossing of the Senio river until the surrender of Germany.   At that time the military policeman were delighted to find themselves serving in British occupied Carinthia, one of the lovliest parts of Austria."

HOUSE SEARCH
     At 12.45 Naylor, seen at his home said he had not seen Frost for two days, but when the police said they would search the house he replied ""I am going to give in.   All the gear you are looking for is in the bedroom.""
     From a cupboard and suitcase the officers recovered property including 31,000 cigarettes and a large quantity of liquor and sweets.
     Sergeant Cyril Frederick Curtis said that after the Vauxhall had ignored his signal to stop he went to Hunslet Police Station.
     About 6.30 am he saw the car travelling along Low Road at about 60 mph, with a police car immediately behind.   Witness hurled his truncheon at the windscreen of the Vauxhall and jumped clear.   The attempt to stop the car failed.
     Police Constable Noel Edward Donne described how he picked up the wanted car in Moore Road, after searching Middleton and Belle Isle.   The chase lasted for about six miles.
     In Low Road as the police car drew level, the Vauxhall tried to side-skid and crashed.
     Other cars joined in, and one police car swerved across the road ahead of the pursued car in an attempt to stop it.
      As the Vauxhall attempted a violent turn into Sheaf Street it skidded violently head on into a shop.
     Sergeant Grimes, Church Fenton said the missing property included 33.800 cigarettes and 45 bottles of liquor about 300 worth of property had been recovered.
     The other car alleged to have been stolen was later found abandoned of York Road.
     Beaumont and Timblin who pleaded guilty to breaking into the RAF Sergeants' Mess (Church Fenton) but not guilty of stealing the cars, and Naylor, who pleaded not guilty to receiving were sent for trial.   Timblin and Naylor were granted bail.
     The bench commended the police.

Extract from the Derbyshire Courier, 20/1/1900.   Letter From Clay Cross Man.
The following letter from No. 439, Cpl T Priest, Military Foot Police has been received by his Mother at Clay Cross.   ""The month of January here is midsummer and everything looks nice and green at present.   I am pleased to say we have no Lions about here; Although I saw where one soldier had died through being mauled by one.   Snakes are plentiful.   We are seeing some awful sights, an Officer and two Sergeants died from their wounds, and there a a good many with only one leg and one arm.   Six Boer prisoners (wounded) are with us.   I have no fancy of being sewn in a blanket and thrown into a hole.""   In another letter he says;  Her at Wynberg Hospital we have about 1000 wounded, and some awful sights, worse than any coal mining disaster.   We have not been called upon to take part in any engagement at present.  We are in a very rummy state out here and I don't know how long it will last, but when you get this letter there will be quite a few changes out here.   We have to sleep every night with our revolvers under our heads.   I shall expect seeing George and William Henry out in South Africa if we do not get on any better than we have been doing.   no doubt you will have heard before this that we had to break up the little home, through me coming out here.   I thought it was best to do as I may have to stop here after the war is over.   There appears to be many different classes of people out here, in fact most of the are black, Zulu, Indian etc.   I should not care much to be kept out here.

Extract from the Birmingham Daily Post, 5/4/1958.   Death Penalty for Terrorism Back in Cyprus.
Two More Soldiers Killed.
The death penalty became mandatory for all terrorist offences in Cyprus after two British soldiers had been murdered in Famagusta yesterday.
     New emergency regulations were hurried through last night, giving judges no option but to pass the death sentence on anyone carrying or being in possession of firearms and bombs.
     The Governor Sir Hugh Foot acted swiftly as British troops took over full control of Famagusta where the two soldiers were shot down in a street full of people taking a Sunday stroll.
     His political and military advisers agreed to reintroduce the mandatory death penalties first established by the former Governor, Sir John Harding and lifted when tension eased after the EOKA truce last year.
Dragnet Operation.
     The murder of the two men who were members of the Royal Military Police was followed by the biggest dragnet operation since the outbreak began in the island.   They were on duty in plain clothes, patrolling a part of the Greek quarter normally out of bounds to British troops.
     The murders yesterday - which brings to 106 the total of British killed since the emergency - were he first since the expiring on April 28 of an EOKA terrorist ultimatum that reprisals would be taken against Britons would be resumed unless allegedly ""inhuman measures"" in British detention camps were stopped.
     The Governor will return to London this week for new talks on the island's future.

Extract from the Western Mail, 5/5/1958.   Sir Hugh brings back death law.
     Two British soldiers were shot dead among strolling afternoon crowds in Famagusta yesterday - and immediately the Governor of Cyprus, Sir Hugh Foot, brought back the tough emergency regulations first established by his predecessor, Sir John Harding.
     The death penalty became mandatory for all terrorist offences.   Judges have no option but to pass the death sentence on anyone carrying or possessing firearms and bombs.
     Sir Hugh acted swiftly as troops took over full control of the city where the soldiers were shot and began the biggest dragnet operation in three years.
     His political and military advisers agreed to reintroduce the mandatory death penalty which were lifted when tension eased on the island after the EOKA truce last year.
Fired Back
    The soldiers, in plain clothes but on duty, were patrolling a part of the Greek quarter, normally out of bounds to British troops.
     They were Lance Corporal B F Turvey of Cambourne Avenue, Harold Hill, Romford Essex, and Lance Corporal W N Cameron of Lawrence Drive, Leven, Fifeshire both members of the Royal Military Police.
     One of the soldiers crumpled on the pavement at the first blast which hit him in the back.   His companion managed to turn, pull out a revolver and fire a shot before he, too, was hit.
Searched
     Troops immediately swooped on the area and arrested every Greek Cypriot youth in sight.   Official reports said the number held for questioning was ""between 300 and 400.""   Greek Cypriot sources claimed it was as many as 600.
     Greek flags displayed on some buildings were ripped down by troops while large scale searches of houses in the area were carried out.
     A security forces spokesman said: ""It is believed the gunmen knew who they were shooting.   The killing follows the pattern of previous EOKA murders.""
     The shooting came only 24 hours after an official announcement that the Governor intended to fly to London early this week for talks with the British government on the future of Cyprus.
     In a broadcast statement last month he said his London trip would depend on whether violence continued.
     The murders were the first since the expiry, on April 23, of an EOKA terrorist ultimatum which said reprisals against Britons would be resumed unless ""inhuman measures"" in British detention camps were stopped.

Extract from the Staffordshire Sentinel 6 November 1939.   KEEN HORSEMAN AND SWIMMER.
     We regret to record the death of Police Sergeant Thomas Flower of the Stoke on Trent City Police Force who, since 1929 was in charge of the Birches Head section.
     Sergeant Flower was taken ill last Saturday week and was operated on in London Road hospital for appendicitis.   Complications set in and he passed away yesterday.   He was 51 years of age and leaves a widow and a son, to whom sympathy is extended.
      He was a native of Stone and joined the Hanley Division in 1910.   He was always a keen horseman and was a member of the mounted branch in Hanley before the Great War.   He joined up soon after the war started and served throughout with the Military Mounted Police in France.
     When he was demobilized he went to Loughton, where he served as a constable until 1923, when he was appointed Sergeant at Burslem.
SPORT INTERESTS.
     Police Sergeant Flower remained at Burslem for four years where he made many friends.   He took charge of the Birches Head Section in 1929, remaining there until the time of his death.
     Sergeant Flower was always a keen sportsman.   he was a very healthy man, up to the time of his illness and scarcely a day went by without him having his swim in Hanley Baths.   He maintained this practice during the coldest weather.
     He was regarded in police circles as a conscientious and reliable officer who will be greatly missed in the Force.   he was a member of the City Police Sports Club Committee.
     The funeral will take place at Burslem Cemetery at 3.30 on Thursday."

Extract from the Dover Express, 15/10/1909.   WOMAN RESCUED FROM DOCKS.
Military Policeman's brave act.   At the Dover Police Court on Tuesday, before Messrs. M Pepper, E Chitty, and J W Bussey, Mary Jarman, a middle aged woman, who sobbed when the charge was read, was charged with attempting to commit suicide by jumping into the Wellington Dock on Monday night.   L/Cpl Harry Gaff, of the Military Foot Police said that on Monday evening he was on police duty on the quayside, with L/Cpl Ashwick, Military Foot Police when a woman ran past them from the roads towards the dock.   Something else attracted their attention in front for a moment, as they did not not dream that the woman intended to jump into the water, but hearing groaning they looked about, and found that she had disappeared.   he went to the dock side and saw the woman struggling in the water.   After throwing off his capo and coat he jumped in, and as he rose to the surface the woman also rose.    It was very dark, but he caught sight of her, grabbed her, and swam to the side of a barge with her.   There he got assistance, and the woman was taken out of the water, and witness got into a boat.   A Constqble came up and took charge of the prisoner, and witness then went home and went to bed,   As he was subject to ague, and did not want another attack.   The Chairman asked witness if under the circumstances he would get any compensation from the Military authorities for the damage to his uniform.   Witness said he was not sure, but he did not think he would.   In answer to the Chairman, the prisoner, who was still sobbing, said her husband left her about a fortnight ago.   She did not know where he was.  The Chairman commended the conduct of the witness Gaff, and said the Bench had in their minds whether they could do anything to make good the damage to his clothes.   if anything could be done they would do it.   Gaff: Thank you, sir.   Police Constable Dunford said that at 10.15 on Tuesday evening he was in Strond Street on duty and hearing a police whistle blown, he ran towards the quayside and when near Mr Hogben's baker's shop he was some people looking into the dock.   They aid that a woman had fallen into the water, and looking over he saw a military policeman in the water, holding the woman with one hand and supporting himself by holding the rudder of a barge.   Witness jumped aboard the barge and threw a rope to the corporal, and with the assistance of by-standers got another round the woman and hauled her aboard.   He found she was conscious and breathing, but she had been drinking.   He loosened the clothing round her neck, and then took her to the police station on an ambulance which had been sent for.   She said nothing till she got the the police station; then she gave her name and address.   Dr E Elliot said he saw the woman at the police station at 10.45.   She was wet through, and had evidently been drinking.   She stated that she had eaten nothing for three days.   A little drink on an empty stomach, combined with the worry of her husband leaving her, had apparently upset her.   If she had proper food she would probably look on the world in a better light.   The Magistrates remanded the prisoner to the Workhouse infirmary till Monday next that she may have proper food and attention.

Extract from the Dover Express, 21/1/1910.   Military Policeman's Gallantry.
After Church Parade at the Castle on Sunday, Brigadier-General Inglefield presented to Lance Corporal Harry Gaff, Military Foot Police, the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal and certificate for rescuing a woman who threw herself in the Wellington Dock on Monday, October 11th 1909.  The General said that Gaff was a brave  man, an his comrades would follow his example.   He hoped that having the medal would help the recipient throughout his civilian life, after the close of his military career.   He then pinned the medal on Corporal Gaff's breast shaking hands with him."

Brian Gate.

A tribute was paid today to a Merseyside military commander who had died at the age of 63.
     Lieutenant Colonel Brian Gait was described as ""one of the bravest of the brave"" after an outstanding career in the forces.
Fearless.   The Liverpool born father of three is the only soldier since World War two to have been awarded both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Distinguished Service Order.
     He was cited for his fearless and inspiring leadership in the Korean War.
     He later served with distinction in Kenya against Mau Mau terrorists.
     Gait was commissioned into the King's Regiment in 1958 and then transferred to the Corps of Military Police.
     In 1972 he was appointed to command the Royal Military Police after which he was awarded the DSO.
     He served as an Army careers officer in Liverpool prior to his retirement.   he had been living in North Wales.
     Lieutenant Colonel Maurice Squier, Regimental Secretary of the Royal Military Police said: ""My lasting impression of him was of superb commander, a perfectionist who did not suffer fools gladly.
     ""He was fiercely loyal and protective of his men who worshiped him."""

Extract from Northampton Mercury, 27/7/45.   RUSHDEN MAN CHASED DESPERADO.
For gallant conduct in carrying out hazardous work in a very brave manner.   Pte (now acting L/Cpl) Kenneth Arthur Gent, Corps of Military Police of Rushden has been awarded the BEM, Military Division.
The official citation states that on February 22, at a petrol depot near Naples, a man was caught obtaining petrol by false pretences.   The unit telephoned for the Military Police and L/Cpl Gent and another NCO arrived in a jeep just as the prisoner made his escape from the unit escort.   They both pursued and he turned and fires several shots from his revolver at them.   After crossing a field on to the main road he went to a 15 cwt truck which was waiting and forced the driver out of the cab at the point of his pistol.   The other NCO ran to the left hand door of the truck, but when a few feet away he saw the prisoner pointing his revolver at him and threw himself to the ground just as the shot was fired.   Outstanding Bravery.   Meantime L/Cpl Gent who had been the driver of the jeep and was a few yards behind the pursuit, saw all this taking place, including as it appeared to him the shooting of the NCO.   He ran to the right hand side of the truck and after a struggle managed to knock the revolver from the mans hand and with the help of the other NCO overpowered him and and took him into custody.   By utter disregard for his safety and knowing he was tackling a desperate character L/Cpl Gent exhibited outstanding bravery, concluded the citation."

A Mons Veteran.   Cpl E Golding, MFP, whose portrait appears on this page, is one of the few Policemen now surviving who took part in the historic retreat from Mons, which was celebrated at the Albert Hall a fortnight ago.   Before the outbreak of war he was a Constable on the North-Eastern Railway, stationed at Newcastle.   He had previously served three years with the Coldstream Guards, and being on the Reserve was called up on the outbreak of war.   He left England on August 12th 1914, for France, and went through the retreat from Mons.   After 12 days' long marching he took part in the battle of the Marne, Sept 6th 1914.   He was wounded at the battle of the Aisne on Sept 24th, and after he had recovered from is wounds he met his regiment on the line of march, and was wounded again in the battle of Ypres.   He fought through Givenchy and Festubert and Loos, where he was wounded a third time.   He was then transferred to the MFP.   On October 18th last he was on traffic duty and when the traffic was at its worst the German airmen dropped bombs all round the village in which he was working.   He stood on duty until the traffic was clear, and for his he was awarded the Military Medal for gallantry and devotion to duty by the Corps Commander of the ANZAC's.

Military Honours.   On September 6th last and interesting ceremony took place at Newcastle, when Cpl Elijah Golding, MFP, who prior to being called up as a Reservist in the Coldstream Guards at the commencement of the war was a NER Constable at Newcastle, was presented, by the Acting Chief of Police in the presence of a large number of his comrades, with the MM awarded him for gallantry and devotion to duty in France October, 1917.   Cpl Golding, who has been three times wounded, has been on active service at Mons, the Marne and the Aisne.   In July, 1916, he was transferred to the MFP, where his devotion to duty during a bombardment was noticed by a General Commanding the ANZAC's, who recommended him for special recognition.   He has since been mentioned in despatches by Sir Douglas Haig.   On the same occasion a silver cigarette case suitably inscribed and some cigarettes were also presented to Cpl Golding.   Cpl Golding, acknowledging the presentations, said he was proud to meet his old comrades under such circumstances; he was going back to the front, but hoped to be amongst them again before long.

Extract from the Western Times 12 March 1948.
POPULAR EXETER POLICEMEN.
     After nearly 35 years' service in Exeter City Police, two well-known constables, who joined the Force on the same day, will retire tomorrow.   They are PC ""Mickey"" Dooling and PC ""Jock"" Graham.
      Now that ther hour approaches for retirement, it may be revealed that PC Dooling's christian name is not ""Mickey"" but Arthur Robert and he is not a native of Ireland.   Nor is ""Jock"" who was christened Cecil Joseph, scots born.   Both are Londoners.   PC Dooling was born in St. Pancras and PC Graham in Westminster.   In 1931 PC's Dooling and Grahams were awarded the Exeter City Police Long Service & Good Conduct Medals.
     PC Graham who served in the Military Mounted Police from 1915 to 1919 was commended in 1920 for giving first-aid in a case of a severely complicated fracture and was highly commended later for his diligence and astuteness in investigating a case of pavilion-breaking in 1932.
     These two officers, who have served the citizens well, hang up their helmets for the last time tomorrow - just five years behind schedule.   But for the war and post war police manning problems, they would have retired in 1943"

During the troubles (Ireland) a young artillery officer in Cork had attracted the attention of the provost authorities because of his energy and firmness.   He was Lieutenant A P Green, late to become the well-loved and efficient APM of Belfast in the Second World War and to complete his provost service as Deputy Provost Marshal in Berlin.   Second World War: At Home, page 49.   The sudden arrival of American troops in Northern Ireland set the police there the biggest problem they had yet had to tackle - a vast disembarkation of troops in the comparatively small port of Belfast.   However, all went well largely owing to the energy and ability of Major A P Green, APM Belfast.

Extract from the Newcastle Journal. 12/10/1970.   Soldier Catches Convict on the Run.
A British soldier captured a runaway German convict after a woodland chase at Bielefeld, West Germany on Friday night.
     The soldier heard a noise outside his quarters, looked out and saw a German policeman chasing someone.   He dashed out and gave chase finally cornering the man in a wood.
     The soldier was named as Corporal Antony Guilfoyle, aged 27 of the Royal Military Police from Bradford, Yorkshire.
     He is stationed with the 1st British Corps Provost Company in Bielefeld.
Bottle - Cpl Guilfoyle was spending the last hours of his leave in his Army married quarters with his wife Mary, aged 22, when he heard shots.
   He snatched an empty bottle from the kitchen and set off to investigate.
     the chase lasted five minutes.   Then the unknown man raced into his jacket but Cpl Guilfoyle threatened him with the bottle and he surrendered.
   The two were joined by the German policeman three minutes later and the man was taken to a police station.
   The German CID named the man as Gustav Spolke who broke out of a Frankfurt jail a few weeks ago.

Extract from the South London Observer 23 July 1932.   PRESENTATION TO EX-P.C.
     The billiard room at Camberwell Police station was the scene at an interesting ceremony on the afternoon of the 13 inst.   The occasion being the presentation  of a testimonial  to P.C. Hanna (""L"" Division) on his retirement after 25 years.   P.C. Hanna joined the Force on May 27, 1907, being posted to the ""E"" Division at Bow Street.   Four years later he was appointed to the mounted branch and transferred to ""F"" Division at Camberwell.   Called up on the army Reserve on August 5, 1914, having previously served five years in the 1st Royal Dragoons, he proceeded overseas, being attached to the Military Mounted Police.   He was appointed the Sergeant in charge of the 31st Division and served in Egypt, France and Belgium and on the formation of traffic control squadrons was made squadron quartermaster sergeant of No.1 Squadron.   On the Armistice being signed he was sent to Germany for Army of Occupation duties, being demobilised in July, 1919.  He then rejoined the Metropolitan Police and served in the mounted branch at Camberwell for 12 1/2 years, then reverting to patrol duty which he performed down to the time of retirement.
     Addressing a large gathering of officers and men inspector Adams, in the unavoidable absence of Superintendent white, said they had met that afternoon to bide adieu to an old comrade in the person of P.C. Hanna.   Many of them had known him longer than he had, but he could say that during the past 12 months that he (Inspector Adams) had been at the station he had always found him ""one of the best"" and not doubt he had the confidence of all the station officers which was a great thing in the police.   Having referred to P.C. Hanna's police and army records Inspector Adams said the officers and men of the division felt that they could not allow the opportunity to pass without showing in some tangible form their appreciation of his services and they had therefore subscribed, to  a handsome Westminster chiming clock, together with a silver watch, both suitably inscribed, which he had much pleasure in handing to him on their behalf, expressing the hope that he would be spared many years to enjoy his pension.
     Mr. Hanna acknowledged the gifts in a neat and appropriate speech and was accorded the ""Camberwell Whisper"" - three hearty cheers, a similar compliment being paid to Inspector Adams on the proposition of Sergt. Fernie, Sergts, Wells, Hicks and officers of the C.I.D. were amongst the large company present together with P.C. Frank Norman, who was responsible for organising the testimonial."

Extract from the Essex Newsman 3 February 1917.
TWO BRAVE M.M.P.'s.  MILITARY MEDALS PRESENTED AT CHELMSFORD.
     An interesting presentation of Military Medals took place in Admiral's Park, Chelmsford, on Monday, when Brig.-Gen. Daniel pinned the medals upon the tunics of Sergt. J.L. Harper and Cpl. G Buck, both of the Military Mounted Police.   For the ceremony a Battalion was paraded under Lieut.-Col. Wilson, together with a party of the M.M.P. under Squadron Sergeant Major Murfit.   The General who was received with customary salute by the troops and the band, was attended by an A.D.C.   The A.P.M. Capt E. J. Solano and the Mayor of Chelmsford (Ald. J. O. Thompson, J.P. ? also present.)
     General Daniel said he had been asked to present the two medals for bravery in the field - two of the most coveted distinctions a soldier could wear, except the V.C., and he daresay in many cases the men winning those medals for bravery in the field had done just as gallant and good services as those who were wearing the more coveted decorations.   The General then read the official account of the deeds which won the medals as under.   
Sergt. Harper: For gallantry and conspicuous bravery in Gallipoli, saving 109 boxes of ammunition under heavy fire.   he was in command of 109 mules with a Zion Mule Corps.   The drivers ran away and this NCO worked with two men and saved the ammunition.
Corporal Buck:  This N.C.O. and another were on duty near Bellevue Farm, Albert, on July 19, at cross-roads important to traffic, the post was heavily shelled.   About 4 p.m. a shell exploded a bomb store.   The above mentioned N.C.O., despite the continuous shelling of the road near the post and the explosions of bombs, succeeded in diverting the traffic and regulating it without accident, casualty or congestion, they also cleared the road of unexploded bombs, which might have caused injury.

Extract from the Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer. 10/2/1953. Leeds man's body found.   From our Ipswich correspondent.
     Searchers in Felixstowe yesterday recovered the body of Sergeant Cyril Stanley Tidswell a 37 year old member of the Corps of Military Police and a native of Leeds, who had been reported missing from Landguard Fort, Felixtowe, where he had married quarters.
     The body was found on Langer Common.   Sergeant Tidswell is believed to have been drowned in the floods which swept the town on the night of January 31.
     Sergeant Tidswell who had been in the Army for about 20 years was stationed at the transit camp at Harwich.   He was apparently visiting his wife, who is a Leeds woman and his two children, when the surging waters struck the building, quickly flooding it to a depth of over five feet.
     His wife, who was saved, is now living in married quarters in an Army camp at Colchester.

Sailor returns Stirling lady's picture.   Mrs Hart, Parkgate, Stirling has just had a picture of herself which she gave to her husband Sgt W B Hart, Corps of Military Police returned to her under unusual circumstances.   The photograph and an accompanying letter enclosed in a leather wallet was accidentally dropped in a British naval craft in Italy by Mrs Hart's husband and discovered and this is where the long arm of coincidence  comes in - by Stoker John McCormack, Royal Navy, of 70 Drip Road, Stirling.   As both the letters bore the address ""Parkgate, Stirling""and the photograph was signed Marjorie, McCormack sent the photograph to us with the request that we find the owner, which we had no difficulty in doing.   Mrs Hart was delighted to receive the photograph when she called at the ""Observer"" office in response to our telephone message.   She mentioned that her husband is a Liverpool man and has been in Italy since it was invaded.   It seems likely that he lost the Wallet whilst on board ship and it has now only come to light, possibly having been concealed in some inaccessible part of the ship's fittings.   Mrs Hart is extremely grateful to Stoker McCormack to whom she intends to write personally, expressing her thanks.   Mrs Hart is the daughter of Mr & Mrs James Mitchell of Parkgate, Stirling."

Extract from the Evening Herald (Dublin) 26/6/2003.   Para Deaths 'misunderstanding'
A ""MISUNDERSTANDING"" over weapons searches was today blamed for mob scenes in Iraq on the day six soldiers were killed.
     Major General Peter Wall said the crowd violence that lead to eight Paras being wounded in a firefight seemed ""to have stemmed from a misunderstanding"".
     He offered no explanation for the reported two hour police station siege which left six Royal Military Police soldiers dead, amid claims that four of the men might have been executed with their own guns.
     The senior British commander said he could not comment on the claims while an investigation into Tuesday's shooting was being carried out.
     Reports had claimed that all the violence was triggered by anger of alleged heavy handed weapons searches in and around the southern town of Al Majar al-Kabir."

Extract from the Birmingham Daily Post.   RSM refused to serve in Ulster
A Regimental Sergeant Major is to be discharged today, two years short of his pension, because he refused to serve in Northern Ireland.
     Warrant Officer Tony Hodsman who has been in the Royal Military Police for 21 years said the health of his wife and child, age eight, who suffers from a nervous complaint prevented him from accepting a two year posting.
     Lord Brayley, Under Secretary of State for the Army, will consider a letter about the case today from Mr Anthony Buck, Conservative MP for Colchester.
     Warrant Officer Hodsman age 39, holder of the British Empire Medal, said last night that he feared an Ulster posting would kill his wife, who suffers from asthma.
     ""The Army is throwing me out and my whole career is going down the drain. he said.
     He claimed that the Army had disregarded a medical certificate from the family doctor advising that he should not be sent to Ulster.
     Warrant Officer Hodsman will lose his 20 a week pension and receive a 1,000 gratuity instead of 2,000.
     Mr Buck his MP said ""I have a great deal of sympathy with Mr Hodsman and I am hopeful that the Army will allow him to serve out his two years in Colchester.""
     A Ministry of Defence spokesman said later : ""Only two days ago the Under Secretary of State for the Army decided that there was no reason for him to alter his previous decision, an Warrant Officer Hodsman must be discharged.

Extract from Birmingham Daily Post, 10/7/1974.   RSM given reprieve by Army.
     A regimental sergeant major who was due to be discharged from the Army because he refused to go to Ulster was given a reprieve last night.
     But Army chiefs want him to promise that if the need arises he will be prepared to accept a posting in the province.
     WO Tony Hodsman age 39, said ""no"" to Ulster because he feared it would kill his asthmatic wife.   Their eight year old son also has a nervous complaint.
     He was to have been discharged at Midnight last night after 21 years in the Royal Military Police and two years short of his pension
     Earlier yesterday, an Army spokesman said he would be able to stay on ""indefinitely"" at his Army home.
     WO Hodsman, who holds the British Empire Medal would have lost his 20 a week pension.
     His gratuity would have been cut from 3,000 to 1,000.   But for his MP Mr Antony Buck (Colchester) himself a former Defence Minister, stepped in.
     He contacted Lord Brayley Under Secretary of State for the army and urged a reprieve in view of the RSM's service record."

RAOB - A meeting of the Marshall Hall Lodge was held on Tuesday evening.   It was opened by Primo T Ratt with Bro. Bennett in the C.M. Chair, both gentlemen being in uniform.   The business of the lodge having been disposed o, the l.H. was welcomed with acclamation.   Bro. Peacock opened the entertainment with a well rendered ,military march on the dominoes, followed by ""Boys in Khaki, Boys in Blue,"" sung by Bro. Humphries.   Then entered unexpectedly Primo S H Holl, sergeant in the Military Mounted Police, just returned from the front.   Naturally in his case fines were dispensed with and a toll collected from the brethren.   Then, on the proposition of Primo M. Hyslop, seconded by Bro. I Smith, Sergeant Holl entertained the lodge with an account of his experiences during his absence on military service.   The brethren were gratified to hear from Primo Holl that although far from the Marshall Hall lodge, he had not forgotten Buffaloism, and that he with others had founded another lodge, called ""8th Divisional War Lodge."" and in spite of the conditions prevailing, it was carried on successfully for the benefit of the Order.   He went into a lengthy description of the first RAPB ambulance car and explained that while providing the car, brethren of the Order had not fo5rgotten to make provision for the wear and tear,   Primo Holl then gave his own original toast which he forwarded from the front at Christmas ""To the Absent Ones."".   The lodge closed with due form and harmony.

     Hinckley soldiers at the front continue to add to their already creditable record of awards.  News is to hand that three more of their number has been awarded the Military Medal for bravery in the field, the recipients being: Sergtr.-Major S. Holl, of the Military Mounted Police.   Sergt. Major S. H Holl is a well known Hinckley man.   He volunteered his services to the Army soon after the outbreak of war and was promptly accepted, having considerable previous Army experience and holds the Good Conduct and Long Service Medal.   It is understood that his decoration is the result of the gallant way in which he led him men on to the battlefield to bring in prisoners.   Holl went through the South African War and brought home a number of trophies, including a Boer shell, which for the past two years served as a collecting box at Hinckley Constitutional Club, of which Holl is a member, for cigarettes for the troops in France.   Prior to the outbreak of war he was employed at the hosiery warehouse of Messrs. Simpkin, Son, and Emery, Hinckley."

Extract from Army Form B 117 found in Army Record:  L/Cpl Huggett i/c Military Police canteen was taking a bottle of lemonade out of the ice chest in the Military Police Canteen when the bottle burst and cut him on the right forearm.   This occurred at Abbassia  on May 15th.  Capt. MMP I do not consider this NCO to blame.
Extract from a Court of Enquiry held at Abbassia, Cairo on the 28/10/1908 investigating the circumstances attending the injury sustained by No. 481, Cpl, A Huggett.
1st Evidence.   No. 481, Cpl A Huggett, MMP states:  In the Chaleh Abbas on the 3rd inst. I was returning with a detachment of the Mounted Police from Cas El Nil Barracks from the GOC's Inspection, we were moving at a trot and on being ordered to walk my horse stumbled and threw me forward in the saddle.   I immediately felt a sharp pain in the bottom of my stomach which caused we to feel very sick.   I fell out and got off my horse and after a minute or so I remounted with the assistance of Cpl Savage.   We then road slowly to the stables in Abbassia.   On arriving at the sables I reported by accident to Squadron Sergeant Major Negerty, who told me to report sick if I felt worse.    On arriving at my quarters I saw there was a small swelling at the base of my stomach.   I reported sick the next morning and the medical officer fitted me with a truss.

Extract from the Oban Times 28 March 1931.   YEOMAN OF THE TOWER OF LONDON.   Yeoman Warder Angus Whyte.
    It is a far cry to the tower of London, but the portrait above will be interesting to our readers.   First, because it is that of a true Highlander, secondly, because it shows probably the most ancient style of dress still worn without variation.
     The Yeoman Warders of the Tower must not be confused with the Yeoman of the Guard, who are often called ""Beefeaters."" not because favour of that diet, but for the reason, but the reason that the original Norman familiar appellation ""Buffetars."" lent itself in that sound to that corruption.   The Yeoman Warders of the Tower are extraordinary members of His Majesty's  Yeoman of the Guard and hold precedence by standing on the right of the Sovereign on certain State occasions.   The Yeoman Warders number forty and are drawn from time expired warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Army, whose service and character are above reproach.   The Yeoman live within the Tower and their modern duties consist of guarding he Regalia and guiding visitors through the historic buildings.
A FORMER STRANGE CUSTOM.
    In former times they were the Warders of the State prisoners confined in the Tower and accompanied them to Westminster Hall for trial.   On these occasions the Yeoman Gaoler or Chief Warder marched on the side of the prisoner with the axe on his shoulder, blade downwards.   On the return to the Tower, if the axe was born on shoulder with the blade towards the unhappy victim.   Then the populace would know the fate of the prisoner.
His Military Service. 
     Yeoman Warder Angus Whyte enlisted in the 9th Lancers at Inverness in 1891 at the age of 17.   He served in that Regiment until 1895, when he transferred to the Mounted Military Police as corporal.   On the outbreak of the South African War he was selected for duty with the Headquarters Staff of General Sir Redvers Buller and took part in all the actions in the Natal district and the Transvaal.   He was awarded the South African Medal, with clasps for Cape Colony,m Tugela Heights, Relief of Ladysmith and the Medal for long service and good conduct.
     In 1909 he was in charge o0f the Military Mounted Police in Alexandria and later Cairo on promotion to Squadron Sergeant Major.   On the outbreak of the Grea5t War he went with the Expeditionary Force and took part in the memorable and gallant stand of the regular British Army.   He served until 1915 and was then appointed Yeoman Warder of the Tower.   During the latter years of the War the Tower became a prison house for the German spies captured and the Yeoman had to resort to their original occupation and Yeoman Warder Whyte, from his experience in the Military Police both at home and abroad was considered specially suitable for the sudden and exciting duties involved.
Of a Well Known Highland Family.
     It is his relations to the Highlands which makes Angus Whyte's career interesting.   He was born in Fort William an still retains his Gaelic.   His father was Mr. Shyte, contractor, who has claim to have constructed the highest building in Britain, namely the Metrological Stations on the top of Ben Nevis.   An uncle was the famous Gaelic scholar, Henry Whyte, who, as ""Fiost"" was the valued Glasgow correspondent of the Oban Times and contributed song and story to its columns for many years.   Another uncle was John Whyte of the Inverness Library.   Warder Angus is not wanting in the literary gifts of the family.   He has a comprehensive and accurate knowledge of history, with powers of description far above the average and cause him to be sought by those who desire a more than ordinary guide book description of that grim fortress, to which a reference finds its way into every chapter of English history.   it is pleasing that his sons have attained valuable positions in military and civil life.   One is a Flight Lieutenant in the Air Force, another is a Stockbroker and another a Shipbuilding draughtsman.   His sole brother, the Rev. N MacKenzie Whyte is minister at Strathtay.
   The only other Scotsman among the Warder yeoman is K. MacRae, also an Inverness shire man.
The article has a bull picture of Mr Whyte in the Beefeaters full dress uniform .

AFFILIATION.
     Charles Isaac, of the Military Mounted Police, was summoned by Annie Eliza Doris Ford, at Amesbury, to shown cause why he should not contribute to the support of her illegitimate child, of which she alleged he was the father.
     Mr. F. Trethowan appeared for the applicant and stated that the child was a girl and was born on December 11th.
     Defendant admitted paternity, but said the matter would have been settled months ago if the girl had behaved fairly towards him.   He promised to marry her and wrote to her from abroad, but on hi arrival he found a letter saying that she did not wish to have any more to do with him.   He found she had been with someone else.
     The Clerk: That will not relieve him from liability to maintain the child.
     Formal evidence of the birth having been given, an order was made for the defendant to contribute threepence a day till the child is 15 years old."

     The intelligence has been received with great satisfaction in Birkenhead that three members of the Borough Police force who are not fighting in France, have gained the Military Medal.   These are Sergeant Alfred G Jones, of the Military Foot Police, who untill he ""joined up"" was associated with Birkenhead's detective department;  PC 25B (Walter Taylor), also of the Military Foot Police, who has resided at 416 Beckwith Street, and PC 4A (Harry Walker), of 130, Bentinck Street, 6 Battalion Cheshire Regiment.

     ""n the Case of Sergeant Jones - he holds that position in the ""MP"" force in France - a few  particulars have some to  hand.   His is a native of Shropshire, and prior to enlistment was engaged in the detective department of the Birkenhead Force and had proved himself a very capable officer.   He was recently home on leave from France, after being rather severely wounded and on his return to service he was surprised to find himself called upon to receive the Military medal in respect of excellent services rendered by him in march and April last.   He is a married man and had resided in Leta Street."

Extract from the Wiltshire Advertiser 23 February 1905.   PEWSEY - SEVEN DAYS FOR CAMPING OUT.
     At the Police Court on Friday, Casson Beuverie, five navvies named George Owen, Willian Cartwright, John Welsh, James O'Brien and James Everett were brought up in custody charged under the War Office Bye-laws, for camping and bivouacking on the plains.   The evidence of Sergt. Purser of the Military Mounted Police and Sergt. Witt, of the Wilts Constabulary at Ludgershall, showed that there is an unoccupied shed on Perham Down, which in used the storage of canvas and other materials used during the camping season.   The officers mentioned, with two others, went to the shed just before midnight, Thursday and there found the five prisoners asleep and huddled in the canvas cloths.   The officers disturbed them and as they were without ""visible means,"" the military officer handed them over to the custody of Sergt. Witt and they were lodged for the night at Ludgershall Police Station, being brought to Pewsey on Friday.   The building in which the prisoners were was barricaded with hurdles and to gain access to it, it was necessary to remove these.   One of the men disputed the term ""building"" being applied to the place;  he said it was by the roadside and anyone could walk into it without removing anything.   Sergt. Witt described the structure, satisfying the magistrate that it was a building which needed protection in view of the Government property in it.  It was, he said, built of corrugated iron, standing on oak posts each side and the roof resting on a frame.   Some of the men had a few pence on them;  some had no money.   Each prisoner made practically the same defence, Cartwright said he had just arrived on the camp from London and had secured a job.;   He went to one of the doss-houses, but was too late to obtain a bed, as no lodgers were taken after nine o'clock; he offered the superintendent three pence to be allowed to sit under the shelter of the roof, but the latter told him that the rules could not be broken.   Welsh said he had come from Wales, had secured a job, but had not money to go to the doss-house, he saw the structure in which they were found by the roadside and walked into it without disturbing anything.   O'Brien and Everitt also said they had secured work and would have been at it now had they not been taken into custody.

Extract from the Boston Guardian 12 December 1914.   Warning to Licensees.   Grantham Inn Closed by the Military.
    At Grantham on Monday Privates A. Knight and Harry Adams, both of ""D"" Company the Manchester Regiment, stationed at Belton Park, were charged with being drunk on the licensed premised of the Artichokes Inn on the 5th December.   Mr. R. F. M. White defended.
     Sergeant Major Kean, of the Military Mounted Police, said he and Corporal McKay found about 25 soldiers in the inn all the worse for liquor, the defendants being very drunk.   he arrested them.   Adams was so helplessly drunk that he had to bet the assistance of a corporal of the Notts. and Derbyshire Regiment.
     Corroborative evidence was called, after which defendants on oath denied that they were drunk, or that they had been served with drink in the house.   They said they had only one pint of beer each that day
     Mr. T. Lister, the landlord, said defendants had no drink at his house and they only got into the passage.   They were not drunk.
     The magistrates took into consideration the fact that prisoners bore excellent characters in the army and had been in custody since Saturday and discharged them on paying costs.
     The sequel to these proceedings is that Major-General Hammersley, commanding the 11th (Northern) Division of the new army at Belton Park has under the powers given him by the Defence of the Realm Act, issued an order closing the Artichokes Inn, Swinegate, Grantham, absolutely for the sale of intoxicating liquor and this order will remain in force until rescinded by him.

National Roll of the Great War 1914-1918, Section VII, London, page 213.  Sergt-Major.
Having previously served for twenty-one years he volunteered in September 1914 and in the following year was sent to the Dardanelles, where he fought at the Landings at Suvla Bay and in many subsequent engagements until the evacuation.   He afterwards proceeded to Egypt and thence to Salonika where he did gallant service on the Struma front.   He returned home for leave but shortly afterwards was sent to France and served at Ypres, Valenciennes, St. Quentin and in many other operations in the Retreat and Advance of 1918.   He was mentioned in Despatches by General Sir Charles Monro for gallant and distinguished service with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and was awarded the DCM for his excellent work.   He also holds the Sudan medal and the Khedive medal, the 1914-1915 Star, and the General Service, Victory and Long Service and Good Conduct Medals.   He was demobilised in March 1919.

Extract from the Sheffield Daily Telegraph 19 January 1915.
GRANTHAM INNKEEPER FINED.
    The Grantham Borough Magistrates yesterday fined Mrs. E H Garton, licensee of the Blue Horse, London Road, 3 and costs for permitting drunkenness on her licensed premises on the 9th inst.
     From the evidence of Sergeant Major Keane of the Military Mounted Police, it appeared that he visited the Blue Horse, and in one room found about fifteen soldiers, among whom were tow privates in the Border Regiment, who were drunk.   He left the house for the purpose of calling the attention of the civil police to their condition and on returning found that both men had been served with fresh drinks.
     Mr. R M White, for the defence, did not contest the evidence that here were persons found drunk on the premises, but urged that Mrs. Garton too reasonable steps to prevent drunkenness.
     It was stated that after the men were convicted last Monday the house was closed by the military authorities and was still closed.

Extract from the Lewisham Borough News 22 December 1953.   SIGNED HIS CIATION.   FOR MENTION IN DESPATCHES.   Golden Wedding of Catford Veteran.
     Almost exactly the same age as Sir Winston Churchill, Mr. Albert Edward Kean, aged 79, of 69, Newquay Road, Catford, is the proud possessor of a framed ""Mentioned in Despatches"" citation signed b y Sir Winton when he was Secretary of State for War in World War I.
     Mr. Keane and his wife, Mrs. Sarah Minnie Keane, celebrated their Golden Wedding anniversary on Saturday, when there was a party for the family and close friends.
     Their married daughter, Mrs. Ivy Dine, with whom they share a house, was putting the finishing touches to some beautiful decorations - part Christmas, part Golden Wedding in the rooms where the celebrations were held, when a ""Borough News"" reporter called to see her parents.
     Mrs. Keane, an invalid (she has not walked for eight years), but cheerful in spite of her painful arthritis, said that he sons were going to carry her upstairs for the party.
     She showed the ""Borough News"" reporter a new dress she has made for the occasion, every stich of it worked beautifully by hand and said she keeps busy knitting, crocheting and sewing and of course listening to the radio - ""one of my great pleasures;  it's seldom off.""
     Mr. Keane cannot get out like he used to and he and Mrs. Keane sit and reminisce over bygone days.
     Their chief topic is the wonder and joy it has given them to see their family of two daughters and two sons - all married- grow up and do well for themselves.
     Mr. Keane talks also of his Army days - he was in the 21st Lancers, then the Military Mounted Police for sixteen years, during which he became Squadron Sergeant-Major and received the D.C.M. for bravery in the field at the Dardanelles.
     Mrs. Keane saw quite a bit of the world when sh travelled around with her husband when he was din the Army and one of her sons was born in Egypt.
     From their home in Southwark, where they lived for 24 years, Mr. and Mrs. Keane came to Catford 13 years ago and their constant and faithful companions are two Papillon dogs and a tabby cat."

Extract from the Whitstable Times and Herne Bay Herald 18 January 1919.
REWARDS FOR GALLANTRY IN THE FIELD - D.C.M. AND MILITARY MEDAL PRESENTED TO A CANTERBURY POLICE CONSTABLE.
     An interesting ceremony which took place in the Parade room at Canterbury Police Station on Friday last, when P.C. Lawrence was presented by the Chief Constable of the City on behalf of the Military Authorities, with the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal, for two conspicuous acts of gallantry and devotion to duty while serving with the Military Mounted Police in France.
     The two honours so gallantly won by Lawrence came to him for acts of gallantry performed within four days of each other.   On March 25th last, for which act he was awarded the Military Medal, he was on duty upon the canal bridges at Varense near Noyanais, where he gallantry directed and controlled gun and munition transport over the bridge, under extremely heavy shell fire.   The task was one requiring iron nerve and resolution and Lawrence never faltered in the duty allotted to him, despite the terrible bombardment of the bridge which continued the whole time.
     Then on March 29th and for this work he was awarded the D.C.M., he carried out a very trying and exacting task in connection with the retirement of troops, under very considerable stress of circumstances.   Here again he demonstrated a determination and devotion to duty that won for him the admiration ans respect of his senior officers.
     P.C. Lawrence, who joined the Canterbury Police Force on the 18th of June 1908, came to Canterbury with an excellent military record.   Eight years previously he joined the King's regular forces at Aldershot, being attached to the 7th Dragoon Guards.   He was for some time attached to the Garrison Police at Canterbury and saw service with his regiment in the South African War.   Upon the conclusion of that campaign he took his discharge and was on the Reserve.   he was appointed to a vacancy in Canterbury Police Force in which he served until called up on the reserve upon the outbreak of war in 1914.
     The Force paraded at 6 O'clock on Friday to witness the presentation to PC Lawrence of the coveted awards he had received for his military services.
     The Chief Constable said he had been requested by the military authorities to present of behalf of His Majesty the King, the DCM and MM to PC Lawrence, who, until recently was serving as a Sergeant in the Military Mounted Police and he should have the greatest possible pleasure in doing to that evening.   He could assure them that he felt honoured in being selected to perform that duty and he would add that it was the most pleasuring duty he had ever had to perform.   He proposed at this point to read the extract from the Second Supplement of The London Gazette, dated the 3rd of June 1918.   It ran:
     ""His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased, on the occasion of his Majesty's birthday to approve the undermentioned awards for distinguished services in connection with military operations in the Armies of France and Flanders and awards the Distinguished Conduct Medal to P/8087 L/
cpl (A/Sgt) E. Lawrence, Military Mounted Police, Canterbury.   (Loud Cheers.)
     He (Mr. Carlton had in his possession the true abstract of that entry.   The second extract from the London Gazette of the 29th of August 1918 and which ran:-
     ""His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to approve the award of the Military Medal for bravery in the field to the undermentioned non-commissioned officers and men, E. Lawrence, MMP, Canterbury.""   (Loud Cheers.)
     They were all doubtless well aware added the Chief Constable that PC Lawrence joined the Canterbury Police Force on the 8th June 1908 and served until 5th of August 1914, when he resigned to rejoin his Majesty's Forces in France.   He knew they would thoroughly agree with him that their comrade had done his duty, not only whilst serving the the army, but also in that Force. excellently.
     He (Mr Carlton) was proud of the fact that he was a member of that Force and he knew that they too were proud of Lawrence and his record.   (Applause.)   The citizens of Canterbury would, he was sure feel grateful to Lawrence for the gallant services he had rendered to the Empire during the greatest war that had ever raged.   He might add that Lawrence, immediately on his release from the Army, applied to him (the Chief Constable0nto rejoin the force and he had pleasure in stating that  he hoped to commence his duties in the course of a few days.   (Applause.)   Mr. Carlton then handed the constable the DCM and the Military Medal and said he hoped that Lawrence would live long to wear them.   
     P. C. Lawrence, who was accorded a very hearty reception, modestly acknowledged the compliment that had been paid him and said he had not done more than his duty.   He hoped that he would continue to do his duty while he was a member of th Canterbury Police Force.   (Applause.)
     Inspector Smith added a few words of welcome to P. C. Lawrence on his return and bore testimony to the efficient way in which Lawrence carried out his duties as a member of the Canterbury Police Force.
     Sergeant Ewell and P.C. Reynolds also congratulated Lawrence and expressed the pleasure they felt at seeing him among them again.

Corpl. Samuel C Saunders, MMP stationed at Fleet and billeted at the Oatsheaf, died very suddenly on Thursday, the 7th inst.   He was found sitting on a seat at the rear of the premised, having expired presumably while in a fit.  He was a man greatly liked by the people of Fleet and the news of his death was received with the deepest regret by the villagers.   He was 32 years of age and unmarried.   He originally belonged to the 5th Dragoon Guards and had 13 years service, the latter eight of which had been passed in the MMP.   He took part in the Egyptian Campaign of 1882 and came home invalided.   Dr McSwiney certified at an inquest which was held by Mr Spencer Clarke that death ws due to acute cerebal congestion, and a verdict of ""Death by natural causes"" was returned.   His brother died suddenly some twelve months back in London and his father is said to have also expired suddenly, so the inference is that  the complaint is a family one.   The remains were interred on Saturday last at deceased's home in Ipswich, Suffolk.   The handsome polished coffin was taken by Mr Finch, garrison undertaker to the station in a hearse and was accompanied to Ipswich by deceased's brother, a friend representing his mother  and the undertaker.   On the coffin were several beautiful wreaths, including one from the inhabitants of Fleet and another from the Corps of Military Police.

Extract from the Surrey Advertiser 10 November 1915.   SOME WAR LETTERS.   FIGHTERS' APPEAL TO ELIBIBLE MEN.
     Squadron Sergt. Major A. H. Lelliott, of the Military Mounted Police, who before the war was one of the officers at the Guildford Workhouse, has sent an interesting letter to a friend in the town giving a vivid picture of the battle of September 25th.   he says that the work of the Military Mounted Police is of a very dangerous nature, the duties continually taking them under heavy shell fire.   Coming to September 25th, he says:  ""I was in the siege of Ladysmith during the South African war and I can honestly say that I heard and saw more heavy gun fire on the morning of September 25th than I heard during the whole of the South African war.   It was simply ""Hell"" itself:  and by far the greatest battel of the war.   The earth shook under us with the vibration of the guns.   The attack took place at 6 a.m. in the greyness of the early dawn.   The infantry lay in the trenches in feverish excitement.   They could hardly be held in their trenches.   All is now ready.   There is a mysterious silence.   The general order to advance was passed along the line an in an instant our men, with fixed bayonets, were over the parapets and into the German trenches, giving the Germans a taste of British steel.""   After describing the strength of the German trenches, the writer says:  ""If only men could see the once peaceful and happy homes here, somewhere in France, which have been wrecked and brought to a heap of ruins by the Huns' shells, the once beautiful churches, which were such a pride to the French people now level with the ground and lying like a heap of scrap iron and could hear the stories we hear, day after day, of the way in which the women and children and their homes have had to suffer at the hands of the Germans.   I am sure no Englishman worthy of the name, if fit and eligible, could conscientiously hang back.   Don't let it be said after the greatest war that the world has ever known that any young Guildfordian kept the company of a 'shirker.'   It is very unfair for the mon out here now, who are enduring such indescribable hardships, to think men at home who are fit and eligible to fight, need so much asking to come forward."

A regrettable accident occurred during the morning when a horse ridden by Sergeant Major Gregory, of the Military Mounted Police, threw its rider, who sustained a fracture of the collar bone.

Extract from the Morning Post 9 July 1898.   THE QUEEN AT ALDERTHOT.   From our correspondent, Aldershot, Friday.
     The Queen brought her visit to Aldershot to a termination shortly after noon to-day.   Contrary to general anticipation her Majesty did not perform the ceremony of opening the New Military Hospital, for the very good reason that the buildings are not yet complete.   Glorious weather has prevailed throughout the Royal visit and the queen's departure took place under conditions as brilliant as those which marked her arrival.   Yesterday her Majesty's drive before luncheon took her through those parts of the Aldershot district where regiments are under canvas at this time of the year.   This morning she ordered that her departure tout should be so disposed that she might view almost in their entirety the magnificent modern barracks, offices, gymnasia and recreation establishments of which the present day Aldershot is composed and afford those who dwell in them an opportunity of seeing her.   The Queen's departure from the Royal Pavilion was timed for twenty minutes past eleven, but it was some time later than this when an actual start was made.   The Queen's escort was found by the 12th Lancers.   At the guard-room, which stands adjacent to the lodge gates of the Pavilion, there was a guard of honour of  the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment and from the gates the route was for a few yards along the Farnham-Farnborough road, then, turning sharply to the right, by way of Wellington avenue, through the Cavalry lines, to the Cranbrook Road, fro which point eh route was almost due North to Marlborough lines, where a turn to the left leads to the Queen's Hotel an thence to the railways station at Farnborough.   The troops of the Division lined the route.   The Cavalry Brigade were in their own locale, from the Pavilion gates along the Wellington avenue to Cranbrook Road and the Horse and Field Artillery from the East Gate of Wellington Avenue to the cross-roads by Corunna and Maida Barracks.   From this point the roads were lined by the troops of the three Infantry Brigades, extending the whole length of the Cranbrook Road and thence as far as the Queen's Hotel.   On Cove plateau a battery of Artillery fired a royal Salute as her Majesty passed of the precincts of the Garrison.
     The Duke of Connaught and the whole of the officers of the Aldershot Staff accompanied the Queen to Farnborough Station.   The cavalcade was led by Sergeant Major Gregory and a Corporal of the Military Mounted Police.   Then came Colonel Douglas, Assistant Adjutant General, who is one of her Majesty's Aides-de-Camp.   The escort of Lancers proceeded the Aldershot Staff, who rode before the Queen's carriage, in which, with her Majesty, were Princess Henr6y of Battenberg and Princess Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein.   The Duke of Connaught, with Colonel Wynne, Deputy Adjutant-General rode immediately  behind the Queer's carriage, which was drawn by four grey horses and proceeded by outriders.   In other carriages were the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Roya Household.
     The Duke of Connaught too leave of her Majesty at Farnborough and the Royal train departed immediately for Windsor, which was reaches soon after one o'clock.   The troops were dismissed by Brigades shortly after the Royal procession had passed between the lines.   At several points along the route there were large crowds of spectators for whose comfort every possible provision was made by the Provost Marshal, Major J. L. Emerson, Chief to the Military Police in the Army."

COURT MARTIAL.   THE DISTURBANCE IN SNARGATE STREET.
     On Friday Gunner James Nolan, 41st Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, was tried by a District Court Martial at Dover Castle, of which Major Stracey, Provisional Battalion , was President, on a charge of striking his superior officer Corporal Flynn, of the Mounted Military Police, who was about to confine him to the main shaft Police cells.   He was further charged with damaging a serve jacket, of the value of 18/6, of which the prisoners share was 6/-, and a pair of riding breeches, value 17/6, of which the prisoners share was 5/10.   The prisoner pleased not guilty to both charges.   Police Constable Hughes said: About 9.30 am on Saturday, the 2nd inst,. I was on point duty at the top of Snargate Street.   I was informed that there were three soldiers drunk in Queens Street interfering with a pair of horses belonging to Messrs. R. Dickenson and Co.    I went there, but found no soldiers.   I was further informed that the men had gone in the direction of Adrian Street.   I afterwards saw Corporal Flynn, of the Military Mounted Police.   I told him of the affair, and he went up Adrian Street and I followed.   We there saw three Artillerymen dancing in the street.   The Corporal told them to make their was down to the Shaft Guardroom.   The prisoner Nolan was one of the men.   One man refused to go and the Corporal got of his horse and got hold of him.  With persuasion they were got into Snargate Street.   There the all three refused to go any further towards the Shaft.   One of the men Ryan struck Corporal Flynn in the face.   I then went to his assistance and handcuffed Ryan, who was not fighting a civilian.  I then secured Nolan and Flynn tied him up.   Nolan and Ryan went quietly to the Shaft.   The President:  You saw all three strike the Corporal: Oh yes, all three struck him.   Did you see the injury to the Corporal's clothes:  I saw his clothes covered in blood.   My own tunic was spoilt.   All the three men were drunk.   Corporal Flynn, Military Mounted Police said:  About 9.45 am on the 2nd of April I was on duty near Queen Street, I went to Adrian Street and saw three gunners of the Royal Garrison Artillery drunk and improperly dressed.   I advised them to go down the Lane, as they would have to come to the Guardroom with me.   They went as far as Snargate Street quietly, but they quietly but they refused to go any further.   The whole three  at a time attacked me.   The prisoner was one of the three men.   In the struggle I was struck by Noland more than once.   With the assistance of the Civil Police I secured him and the other two me, who kicked and stuck me repeatedly in the struggle and confined them in the Shaft Guardroom    During the struggle my clothing was badly torn and damaged by the prisoner an the other two men.   The value of the clothes damages was 36s 2d.   The prisoner, in his defence stated that on the morning of the 2nd he remembered being in Adrian Street and the corporal came up and said that he would put them in the Shaft.   At the bottom of the lanes he tried to get away and a civilian caught hold of him, striking him.   He then lost his temper and commenced fighting and after that could not remember anything as he was knocked down by a civilian.   He did not remember striking the Corporal.   The President:  Do yo mean that the civilian knocked your senseless, yes, that and the drink:  I was very drunk, which made me not answerable for my actions.   The prisoner having been convicted, Lieutenant McCue stated that the prisoner, who had several minor offences against him the the defaulters' book had not bee convicted by a Court Martial.   He had 6 years 247 days service and had the two good conduct badges.   Sentence will be announced later."

Extract from the Hythe, Sandgate & Cheriton Herald 28 November 1908.  LAMP SMASHING.
     Wm. Chas, Chatter, Wm. James Keen, and Wm Harris, privates in the Oxfordshire Light Infantry were charged with smashing a gas lamp.   They pleaded not guilty.  
     Mr. G. W. Haines said that he was present on behalf of the owners of the lamp. the Folkestone Gas na Coke Co..   Recently a number of lamps had been broken and the company felt that they should take proceedings in this case to prevent similar offences.   The extent of the damage was 10s 6d.
     Mr Fredk. Newbury stated that he was manager to Mr. Piggot, Oil and Colour Merchant of Cheriton Road.   There were three lamps outside mr. Piggott's and these were intact at 10.30 pm on Saturday evening.   His attention was drawn to a lamp which was broken that morning.   The glove and mantel were smashed.   The lamp was about 7 feet from the ground.   It could have been easily broken by a cane. 
    Mr. W. C Pritchard (manager of the gas fitting department of the Company) stated that the lamp was valued at 2 10s, and the damage done was about 10s 6d. the cost of the globe and four mantles.   The broken lamp must have been struck with force, as the glove was about1/8th of an inch thick.   If it had dropped itself the basement of the lamp mus have fallen also, but this was intact when he saw it that morning.
     P.C. Simmons stated that on Saturday night he was outside the Shakespeare Hotel at 11.20 in company with Corpl. Loughnane, of the Military Mounted Police.  He witness heard smash.   There were several people about at that time and some passed him.   he did not take particular notice at the time who they were.   he saw three soldiers pass but he could not say whether the defendants were the men.   He went in the direction of the sound and the corporal trotted on ahead with his horse.   Outside Mr. Piggott's shop he was the remains of the broken lamp on the pavement.   The corporal and the three prisoners were close at hand.   There was non on else near, or withing thirty or forty yards of the lamp.   He (witness) saw no one running away.   The prisoners were standing on the pavement by Mr. Piggott's shop, a little beyond the lamp and in the direction of Cheriton.   All three had canes (which were produced).   He asked them which one broke the window, as he thought at the time that it was a window which was broken.   neither of them made any reply at the time.   He told them that he would take them to the Police Station, which he did.   He there charged them with being concerned together in breaking a glass globe.   On the way to the Station Keen said, ""Never mind, say it was a civilian and they ran away.""   When charged the said they knew nothing about it.
     Corpl. Loughnane, of the Military Mounted Police, stated that when he heard the smash he proceeded in the direction of Shorncliffe Camp along the Cheriton Road.   He went quickly with his horse and he saw the two prisoners about thirty or forty seconds later about thirty yards past where he saw the remains of the broken lamp.   They were walking quickly towards Cheriton.   He asked them if they has seen anyone breaking any windows or any glass.   They replied ""No..""   He saw no other persons about there.   he detained them until P.C. Simmons arrived.
     Defendants said they knew nothing at all about it.  There were two civilians about fifty yards to the front of them.
     Defendants were each ordered to pay 3s 6d for the cost of the lamp and in addition to this were fiend 5s and 4s 6d costs (making in all 13s each,)or 14 days hard labour.

Extract from the Kerry News 26 January 1916.   A KILLARNEY SOLDIER AND HIS SON.
     Amongst those visiting their native places this week after long service in France is First Class Warrant Officer, Timothy Lougnane, Killarney, a son of the well remembered owner of the mail car between Killarney and Kenmare in the old days.   Mr. Lougnane is now a Warrant Officer in the Military Mounted Police and has been on service at Rouen, Nantes, Boulogne, etc, since the beginning of the war.   He first joined the 5th Royal Irish Lancers in 18 and later transferred to the 16th Lancers and saw service in India, etc.   On the completion of his terms he joined the Military Mounted Police and came home on a short holiday from the British Expeditionary Force.
     WO Loughnane has a son in the 1st North Staffordshire Regiment who has received the D. C. Medal, as notified in the following letter;-
     To Sergeant Major Lougnane.
     Dear Sir, - Your son behaved exceedingly well on the night of the 12th of last month in helping to repel attacks on a crater in front of our line, which we occupied that night.   Unfortunately he was wounded during the third attack but I hope not seriously.
     Owing to the pluck and endurance, after he was hit I recommended him for the D.C.M. which I am glad to say has been awarded.   Today I received a letter from General Capper commanding the 24th Division asking me to convey his congratulations to Lance Corporal A. S. Loughnane, to which I need not say I added my own.
Yours faithfully F. FALBE

     Corporal W. H. Dyer, of the Military Mounted Police, writing to his wife, who resided as 47, Hight Street, Ryde, Says:-  I was one of the Mounted Police who attended the burial of the young Prince Maurice, beside the escort of the King's Royal rifles.   The general  and his staff were there.   I had a button off his suit, also I picked a piece off a yew tree by the side of his grave.
     ""He was buried on October 30th, at about 8.30 p.m. and not very far away the German big guns were firing on our trenches and our guns were doing their best to put them out of action.   The guns were making such a noise that we could not hear the Chaplain's voice.   So he had a soldier's funeral amidst the noise of battle.   Two floral wreaths were placed over the grave.   It was rather a hot time there, bombs dropping in the street from German aeroplanes and shells at night."

Extract from Litchfield Mercury, 11/7/41:   A Proud Litchfield Mother, MBE For Her Son.
The award of the MBE to RSM William Richard Rea Martin, of the Corps of Military Police, recalls the fact that some years ago he was so badly injured in a motorcar accident that his spine was fractured and his right hip dislocated.  A wonderful recovery enabled him to be passed completely fit for service.   One of the first to congratulate Mr Martin on the award of the MBE, was his 86 year old mother, who lives at Litchfield.   Born in Maidstone Barracks fifty four years ago, Mr Martin enlisted in August, 1914 and in the last Great War served with the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry,   Five of his brothers and two brothers in law also were on active service throughout that campaign.   Mr Martin, whose father had a long association with the Royal West Kent's, speaks Arabic Fluently, and on occasions while out East, on secret police work, he disguised himself as an Arab.   Out of a total of 27 years an 11 months in the Army, he has been a member of the Corps of Military Police for 23, and was promoted Regimental Sergeant Major on the outbreak of the present war,   For a time as a boy he lived with his parents at Worcester, and was educated at St Paul's School.   For a long time he has been discharging his duties at Aldershot,   His main hobbies are fishing, snooker and stamp collecting.   In the pursuit of the last named, he has amassed twenty thousand specimens."

On the outbreak of war Colour Sergeant P. McCaffery, who was then serving in the Eastern Division, City of Glasgow Police, volunteered as drill instructor, and was passed for duty to Hamilton.   Later he assisted in the formation and training of the 18th (R) Bn. HLI, better known as ""Bobs Own,"" and was several times complimented by the magistrates for his excellence in this connection, and also by Lieut Col Shaughnessy (late OC of the Bn.).   Since then he has transferred to the Corps of Military Police, in which department he has gained the rank of Colour Sergeant for his good services and devotion to duty.   Colour Sergeant McCaffery has seen previous active service, having served in the Tirah Expedition, India 1897 and 1898 and in the South African War.   He joined the City of Glasgow Police shortly after his discharge from the Regular Army on transfer to the Army Reserve in 1903.

Extract from the Folkestone, Hythe, Sandgate & Cheriton Herald, 1/11/13.   Police Presentation.
A presentation was made at Folketone Police Station on Thursday, to Corporal McQuade of the Military Foot Police, who has been stationed at Shorncliffe Camp for four years, but who has now received orders to go to London.   Police Sergeant Sales emphasised the cordial sporting relations which had existed between Corporal McQuade  and the members of the borough Force.   He was sure that Corporal McQuade would leave Folkestone with the best wishes of every member of the Force.   Mr h Reeve Chief Constable in making the presentation said that quite shared the regret of the men at Cpl McQuaes departure.   During the time he had been at Folkestone he (Mr Reeve) had heard him spoken of in the highest possilble terms.   He sincerely hoped it was the intention of the military authorities to grants Cpl McQuade promotion on his departure to London.   He had great pleasure in handing to Cpl McQuade on behalf of the members of the Folkestone Force a walking stick as a token of good feeling.   Cpl McQuade in reply, remarked that he had always found the civil and military police very good comrades, both on and off duty, and during his short stay at Folkestone he had managed to unite the two bodies as far as their sports were concerned."

Extract from the Aldershot News 26 July 1907.   POACHING ON GOVERNMENT GROUND.
     Albert Thomas Johnson, Thomas Cheers, and Edward Rees were charged with day poaching on 18th July, at Farnborough.   All denied the charge.
     Sergeant W. J. Broadhurst, Military Mounted Police, at 10 a.m. on 18th, at Puckridge Hill, saw defendants with a dog coming across Laffan's Plain,   Their pockets appeared bulky and two of them went to arrest the defendants, who made off.   Johnson used bad language.   Lees had several nets in his possession. while Johnson escaped.   He never saw the men doing anything in the camp.   The other men had rabbits.
     Corporal Millikin, (Milliken) Military Mounted Police corroborated.   he saw the men on the north side of the canal. near Farnborough Road, coming towards Aldershot from Fleet direction.   Cheers had eight small and four large rabbits on him.   Two of them were alive.
     Witness: We have to arrest the men to get their names at the station.
     Mr Robertson;  You have no right to do so, and you do it at your own risk.
     Johnson admitted poaching but not on Government ground.   He was not on government ground but by the canal bank.   They were poaching at Ewshott.   The Bench after consultation convicted the defendants.   Nothing was known of the men, who were fined 10-6d each or 14 days hard labour."

Extract from the Police Review, page 296, 26 May 1916.
WEST SUSSEX POLICE ON ACTIVE SERVICE.
     Inspector Brett, of the West Sussex Constabulary, Chichester, has received an interesting letter from Cpl. W Osman who is serving in the Divisional Foot Police., BEF, France and was formerly a constable at Bognor.   Writing on 10th May, he says: ""I have not forgotten all about you, and I hope before next year to be back with you in the good old Police Force again - and no grumblings after this life, for this is the limit.   I am at present in charge of 24 men, and six control posts behind the line, where the boys in and out of the trenches.   It is getting a bit better in the trenches now the better weather has come an the mud has disappeared.   I have been under shell fire ever since I came out here, but up to the present I have been lucky.   I was hit on Easter Sunday, but not to hurt much, by a piece of shell.""
     ""This is about the hottest part of the line just here, for they are so close.   It is all bombing.   It makes it awful;  you have to dive for it, or you change it.   I was out last night, and was taking to a man in the Black Watch Regiment.   He left me and got about 20 yards from me when a bomb dropped and tool both his arms off.   I can tell you I soon got him to the dressing station, and cleared out of it:  It was getting a but too hot for me.   I saw PC's Potter, Sloan and Smith last night, going in;  they were all right then.    Poor Smith has got to get down very low, or his head is up above the parapet.   He has turned himself into a company barber.   I saw PC Holmes last week.   He is not QM Sergeant in a machine gun battery commonly known as the suicide club.   He is looking well,    Nichols is about the same old pitch.   You would think it was peace time, to see him.   I have got PC Bennett as sergeant over me.   I have got 24 men and he has got 26 men back at Headquarters, which is about six miles from the firing line.   He won's come to see me much as we get too many shells over for him.   You have heard that PC's Cox and Dean were wounded the last time they were in the trenches."""

Extract from The Scotsman, 22/5/1919.   Death Sentence On A Soldier.
At the Old Bailey, London, yesterday, Arthur Pank (35), soldier, was tried for the murder of Beatrice Pank, his brother's wife, at Tottenham.   The prisoner was a sergeant in the Military Foot Police, and had served in the Army for 19 years.  While on leave last month he visited his sister-in-law's house, and in the evening went up to a policeman and said ""Will you go round with me, I have just shot a woman.""   The prosecution could suggest no motive for the crime, and the only question was as to the prisoner's sanity.   The prison doctor stated the prisoner had told him the story of the tragedy.   He said he and deceased visited his brother in the City, and he returned with her to their home.   After tea, when he said he must be going, she Remarked, ""Oh, there's plenty of time,"" took off her boots, lighted a cigarette, and going to her room called to him.   She made a suggestion, and he said "" If you were my wife I should d for you.""   She laughed and said ""No man would frighten me like that, ""   He then pulled out his revolver, and fired at her.   Realising what he had done, he turned the weapon upon himself, but it twice misfired.   The doctor added that the prisoner realised the seriousness of the offence, and stated that he hand no intention of evading the penalty.   Witness considered the prisoner was in an unstable mental condition, which would probably develop into insanity, and he thought the prisoner's act was the first manifest symptom of his insanity.  Prisoner said he was justified in his action and thought he was defending his brother's honour.   Justice Darling, summing up, asked the jury if they thought it credible in view of all the evidence that what the prisoner had described could possibly have happened, and observed that the evidence was entirely against the story.   The jury found the prisoner guilty.   Sentence of death was passed.   Reduced to 10 years penal servitude.  

Shields Daily News, 10/9/27.   Reprieve of Man needs official explanation. 
The release of Arthur Pank eight years after he had been sentenced to death for the murder of his sister in law at Tottenham and then reprieved is till unsolved.   Pank was drowned at Bournemouth, and was identified in a dramatic way.   The Home Office refuse to state the reason for the release.   ""It is not the custom of the Home Office to give their reason for advising the Crown to Exercise it's prerogative in this matter.""  Said a Home Officer Officer yesterday.   "" A glance through Hansard will show that this is invariably practice that is followed by the Home Office in such cases.   The circumstances in this particular case are of such unprecedented character as to demand an official explanation in the interests of the public.   It is probable that when Parliament re-assembles, a question on the subject will be put to the Home Secretary in the House of Commons.
Convicted.   Arthur Pank, who was a Sergeant in the Military Foot Police, was home on leave from India,when he shot his brother's wife, Beatrice Pank (Downes) in a house in Suffield Road, Tottenham, London in 1919.   He was convicted of murder at the Central Criminal Court and sentenced to death by Mr Justice Darling, who said that the plea of insanity set up by the defence was not supported by the evidence for the prosecution.   Just before the date fixed for his execution Pank was reprieved, and on the advice of the Home Secretary the sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life.   The length of a ""life"" sentence usually means twenty years penal servitude.   Mr George William Pank, brother of the dead man, called at the ""Daily Express"" office yesterday and explained that his brother did not stay with him after his release, but with another brother who had been married a number of years and was living happily with his wife and family.   That brother was not the husband of the murdered woman.   Mr G W Pank added that Arthur was not released on ticket of leave - as was the usual custom - but on ""AA Special,"" which relieved him of the necessity of having to report to the police at all.   The deputy-coroner of Poole, in which district the body was found, said that no good purpose would be served by reopening the inquest, as the identification was established before burial.

Extract from the Sussex Agricultural Express, 23/10/32  RETIREMENT OF PC PLUMMER.
Next Monday, PC Frederick George Plummer of Chailey, retires from East Sussex Constabulary after 25 years service, including four years with the Military Foot Police during the war.   PC Plummer has been stationed at Chailey for the past nine years, and during that time the painstaking and conscientious manner in which he has performed his duties has earned the esteem of the inhabitants.   On Friday, at the Boys' Heritage Craft School, in the presence of the boys and staff, he was presented with a leather suitcase on behalf of the Heritage.   The presentation was made by Leonard Vaughan, who made the case.   Mrs Kimmins, OBE expressed their appreciation of the services PC Plummer had rendered.   one of PC Plummer's most cherished possessions is a solid gold medal with which he was presented by the City of Lille, Belgium, on October 14th 1928.   The presentation took place in connection with the tenth anniversary of the vacation of Lille by the German Army in the closing stages of the war.   The German Army retreated before the final great onslaught of the Allied Armies, and left the city on October 14th 1919.   Before retreating they blew up the bridge leading into the city, and the English troops worked all night to replace it.   Mr. Plummer who was then serving with the Military Foot Police, was the first English soldier to cross the bridge and enter the Grand Place.   it was to celebrate this event that Mr  Plummer was presented with the gold medal by the major of Lille.   For a year after the Armistice, Mr Plummer remained in Lille, and married a French lady.   Mr Plummer, who is a Sussex man, having been born at Ringmer, will continue to reside at Chailey, and as from the first of next moth will act as Chailey Common Ranger.

Extract from the Marylebone Mercury, 22/7/44.   Isleworth RSM in Normandy.
When a part of German prisoners were given some digging work to do in a prisoner of war cage, they appeared too terrified to get on with the work.   on being questioned one of them revealed that they though they were being made to dig their own graves and they took a great deal of convincing that the trenches were required for sanitary purposes.   This story was told to me recently by a Warrant Officer of the Corps of Military Police who had seen some hundreds of German prisoners captured by the Division pass through his POW cage.   He is RSM J Ramsey whose home is at Elmer Gardens, Isleworth.   In the early days of the war he was also in charge of prisoners and he told me that there is a very marked difference between  the captured Germans then and now.   In 1940 they were full of arrogance,    Their average age then was between 23 and 30, now they are nearly all boys between 17 and 20.   They are firmly convinced that if they are taken prisoner they will be shot and I am sure that is why we are having so much trouble with snipers.   HID FOR SIX DAYS.  One prisoner we took did not plead with us not to shoot him, but asked the Intelligence Officer for permission to write a letter home, before we shot him.   There was another case of three Germans who suddenly appeared out of a slit trench only 70 yards from where we had been camped for the last three days.   They were practically starving but had been too frightened. to give themselves up.   It appeared they had been hiding in that trench for six days  with only a handful of biscuits to eat.   One point I have noticed about all of them.   They may be hard boiled Hitler youths but they are all very sentimental about photographs of their mothers of girl friends that they carry with them.   When we search them they don't worry about anything else we take from them, but they plead to be allowed to keep the photographs."

Found in other documents: No. P/1328 Colour Sergeant Rashbrook, MFP states: At Havre on 11th March 1917 at about 10pm I was proceeding from the Quay Escall towards the docks in the company of Sergt. Feddy of the AOC and Sergeant Major Catley of the ASC.   Sergeant Major Catley was walking between myself and Sergeant Feddy and I was on the right hand side of the road nearest the kerb.   i noticed a gleam of light at my feet and shouted ""look out"" and jumped to the kerb.   No warning of approach was given and I heard no horn sounded.   The motor ambulance came from behind us, knocked Sergeant Major Catley down - he fell to the kerb - rolled over and struck his head on the kerb, I actually saw the ambulance strike CSM Catley.   The ambulance made no attempt to swerve out of the way, but carried straight on.   I saw the rear right hand wheel strike him on his leg and had I not jumped myself and Sgt 
Feddy also, we should all three have been caught by the ambulance.   I shouted out to the driver to stop but he took no notice and drove straight on.   I could not distinguish the number of the ambulance or the driver.   I estimated the speed at which the driver was driving at 15 mph.   At the time of the accident we were walking midway between two lamps which were alight on the right hand or south side of the road and we were immediately opposite another lighted lamp on the north side of the road so that I consider there was ample light for the driver of the motor ambulance to have seen us.   I consider anyone with ordinary eyesight could have seen quite 20 feet ahead,  the road was in good condition and fairly dry.

Turning round I saw Cpl Riley and Pte Brunsden on the floor.   Brunsden said ""I have shot that man accidentally"".   Being a qualified first aid man I examined both men but could find no wound on Riley who appeared to have been hit in the stomach.   Brunsden had a hole through his left hand which I at once bandaged.   Signed John P Allan President, Capt APM Advanced Base.   Herewith Court of Inquiry.   Pte J Brunsden was not on duty, but I consider that he was to blame in picking up the revolver, but the owner was equally to blame in having left the revolver loaded.   Col J Hulton. 2/9/1916.

Extract from the Sports Argus, 23/11/1918.
The local swimming community will have doubtless noted that ""Policeman"" Jimmy Riley has had the French Legion of Honour conferred upon him for conspicuous bravery attending to wounded under fire.   But before he went to France he showed that he was chock full of courage on more than one occasion.  The fine physique that he has and a powerful swimmer, that it was no mean feat to jump into a canal lock as he did to save a man's life by the action.  ""Jimmy"" was quite a favourite at Green Lane Baths, and was a polo player of repute.   His rank now is Sergeant-Major in the Military Foot Police.   My congratulations to him, although belated, not suffer from sincerity in that respect."

Extract from the South Eastern Gazette 13 June 1916.   A D.C.M.WINNER.   PRESENTATION AT WREN'S CROSS.
     Yesterday (Monday) morning the presentation of the Distinguished Conduct Medal awarded to P.C. W. J. Robertson, of the K.C.C., and now a Corporal in the Military Mounted Police at the front, was made by the Chief Constable of the County (Colonel Warde) at a parade of the Police at Wren's Cross, Maidstone.   The Chief Constable was accompanied by Captain Stanley Clarke (the Deputy Chief Constable), Supts, Mepsted, Crowhurst and Ambrose, Inspector Barton and Cash, Mr. Robertson (the recipient's father), and other relatives.
     Colonel Warde, in a brief speech, which elicited cheers, spoke of the great pleasure it gave him to make the presentation and said it was a most unique occasion in the history of the Count Constabulary, as P.C. Robertson was the first member of that Force to have the honour and distinction of receiving the D.C.M.   The whole Force were proud of him and he was sure that they all wished him the best of luck in the future.
     The recipient expressed his thanks in a few words, stating that he should never forget the kindness of the chief Constable and all his old comrades of the K.C.C.
     Corporal Roberson was also presented with a silver cigarette by Superintendent and men of the Sittingbourne Division, where he was stationed before joining the Army.
     According the the ""London Gazette,"" Corporal Roberson received the D.C.M. ""For great bravery and consistent good work from May 9th to 28th, 1915, near Ypres.   He was employed both day and night in collecting stragglers, directing traffic and collecting war material.   During May 24th he assisted to places of safety several hundred men who were suffering from gas poisoning.   Most of the time and especially on may 24th and 25th the town was being heavily shelled.
     The Corporal is a native of Maidstone, his parents residing in Brunswick Street and he was educated at All Saints' School.

Extract from the Maidstone Telegraph 26 February 1916.        Over 500 old All Saints' boys are serving in the Forces and Sergt. Sayer is not the first of this gallant army to gain the D.C.M., for Corpl. W. Robertson of the Military Mounted Police won a similar distinction last May for conspicuous bravery near Ypres.  Two others have been recommended for their conduct:- Sergt. J Watson, signaller in the Royal Engineers, and Bombadier Britter, R.F.A.

Extract from the St. Helens Examiner 8 January 1916.   ABSOLUTE FEARLESSNESS.   Commanding Officer's Tribute To Policeman.
     The conduct of Corporal F. Rowles, of the Mounted Military Police and formerly of Warrington, has been favourably commented upon by his superior officers.
     He was on duty at the junction of two roads ""somewhere in France,"" when shelling commenced.   He at once proceeded t  the ""shell"" area to see if he could render any assistance to the troops or inhabitants.   With the other members of  the Mounted Military Police he returned to his post and found the streets full of female employees from one of the factories near by.   He persuaded these and other civilians, also present to take shelter in the houses and refused to allow the troops to stand about the roads.   He proceeded to control the traffic and ensured the free passage of the ambulance vehicles.
     Writing to his mother, who lives at Latchford, Corporal Rowles's commanding officer states: ""His example of absolute fearlessness and calm in trying conditions undoubtedly helped to prevent panic amongst the civilian population.

Police Officers Death.  Supt. T J Runnegar's Career.
     The death, which occurred at his home, Meteren, Tilford Road, Farnham, yesterday (Friday) of Supt. T J Runnegar, has caused deep regret throughout the county.

After the war he came back to the Force and was for a time stationed at Chertsey, from where he transferred to Brookwood.   He was later transferred to Dorking, and went to Farnham on being made Sergeant in 1929.   After two hears he was promoted to the rank of inspector and transferred to Farnham as a superintendent.

Extract from the Aldershot News 4 October 1935,   PROTECTING THE TRADER.   HEAVILY FINED FOR ASSAULT.

     A scene outside a shop was described to the Aldershot Magistrates on Monday when William David Jones  (26) soldier, on bail was charged with assaulting William George Meade and occasioning him bodil6y harm, at Aldershot, on September 21st.
     Mr Michael Game appeared for the defendant.
     Mr. Meade, a fish fryer, 157 Victoria Road, Aldershot, stated that about 9.55 p.m on Saturday, September 21st a man enetered.   He was too drunk to say what he wante3d and stood by the counter.   About ten minutes later he heard a filthy expression and he turned and saw defendant strike a drunken man.
     "" I immediately leaped over the counter."" said the witness, ""and got between them.   Jones struck me over my right eye.   I retaliated and closed with him and got him to the door of the shop,m when I was immediately set upon by four or five other men, who crowded round me.   I let loose myself and knocked two of the down.   Some one jumped on my back, my white overall was torn off.   Jones came in front of me and I was pushed into the doorway of the shop next door.   While I was bent double i was struck a terrific blow on my left cheek by Jones.   I could not way what happened for two or three minutes but the next thing i really remember was finding myself in my kitchen.
     In cross examination,m the witness said he jumped over the counter with the idea of putting Jones outside.  He did not strike Jones first.
     Herbert Stephen Attfield stated that when his employer jumped over the counter and attempted to put out Jones and the drunken man Meade was struck by defendant.
      In cross examination witness denied that Meade pushed other drunken man into Jones.
     L/Cpl. H Rushton, Military Mounted Police stated that he saw Mr. Meade trying to put the defendant out of the shop.   Immediately they reached the footpath four or five persons surrounded Meade, tearing at his white coat and dragged him into a doorway, where the ""set about"" him.   He saw Jones strike Meade with his fist.
      James Richard Kavanagh, of 38, Queen' Road, Aldershot, stated that in the scuffle in the doorway defendant struck Meade in the face an continued to strike him.
     The blow that told was the one to the side of the face in the doorway,"" said Kavanagh.
     William Knight, an employee of Mr. Meade, stated that Jones Struck Meade and the rushed him into a doorway.
Cheek Bone Broken.
     Dr. J. G. Hill stated that he saw Meade on the night of September 21st.   He was suffering from a broken cheek bone.   The fracture could have bee caused by a mans' fist.
     Police Constable Bowes said that when Meade made his accusation Jones did not deny or admit it.   He had been drinking and was excited.   The following morning he saw Jones, who said: ""I had to take a car back for two other corporals.   I walked into the shop.   There was a lot of noise; Meade jumped over the counter, hit me and I hit him back.   he showed his right hand.   The thumb was swollen and the second knuckle was black.
The Defence.
     Mr. Game said he proposed to call evidence to rebut the suggestion of the prosecution that Jones struck the first blow and was the ringleader of the ""scrap.""   There was no doubt that Jones struck Meade, but Meade also struck the defendant and there was an exchange of blows.
     Defendant gave evidence that after leaving a cinema he had three small beers.   He then went to Meade's shop.   There were six or eight men in the corner of the shop and he noticed a drunken man.   This man used a filthy expression and Meade jumped over the counter and tried to put him out.   The man tried to strike Mead, who hit out, missed him and struck him (defendant) on the shoulder.   he his out and stuck Meade on the chin in self defence.   The fighting continued outside, but he went out of it.
     The Magistrates' Clerk:  You say Mr. Meade missed the drunken man and hit you.   An obvious mistake, wasn't it ?   I didn't think it then , but now I do.
     In further examination, defendant said he struck Meade outside the shop.   He had been pushed back a yard.
     Pte. T. J. Jones, who was with the defendant, stated that Meade started to push a mon out, hit at the man, missed him and hit defendant.   The latter staggered back a yard or two and let out a blow.   A crowd gathered an he kept on the outisee3 of the ""ring.""   He did not see defendant again until he entered the shop with a police officer.
     L/Cpl H. L. Butler stated that accused reported at the guardroom at 10.30 p.m. on September 21st.   He was sober.   Pte Jones reported at 10.20 p.m. 
     Capt. R.M. May-Hill gave evidence that defendant has a good military character.
Lost his Temper.
     In imposing a fine of 4 4s, the Chairman told Jones it was perfectly obvious he lost his temper and behaved in a very disgraceful manner.   His business was to help law and order.   When the saw a drunken man being put our of the shop he should have helped instead of which he set upon the unfortunate tradesman who was trying to conduct his business in an orderly and decent manner.   The proper sentence for this king of offence would be two months' hard labour, but in consideration of his good character he would be fined , but the fine must be such as would cause him to reflect upon the wickedness of his action.

COMMISSIONED IN FLEET AIR ARM.
     A former pupil of King Edward VI School, Stafford, Mr Raymond Victor Sabin, age 30, of Oxford Gardens, Stafford has recently been commissioned as an Air Artificer in the Fleet Air Arm.
     He joined the Service 12 years ago as an apprentice and during that time served on the aircraft carriers Ocean and Theseus in Korea and Malta.   Now he is undergoing officer instruction on HMS Thunderer, a shore base at Plymouth.
     A skilful rugby player, he formerly played for Stafford Rugby Club and has represented the Navy in Northern Ireland.
     His father, Mr. T Sabin of 21, Rickerscote Road, is the Vice-Chairman of Stafford British Legion.   he served for 21 years in the cavalry and Military Mounted Police earning among other distinctions, the French honour, the Croix de Guerre. 

Extract from the Staffordshire Newsletter 14 August 1964.   An Old Soldier Looks Back.
Memories of the First World War were recalled by 74 year old Joseph Sabin on Saturday when he went to see the colourful guard of honour - six soldiers of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery - at the wedding of Mr. Anthony Raymond Kinson and Miss Janice Barton Diffin.
     A member of the Old Contemptables Association, Mr Sabin, of 21 Rickerscote Road was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1917 when fighting in France.
     He joined the 3rd Kings Own Hussars in 1909 at the age of 18 and was posted to South Africa.   When war broke out in 1914 he was transferred to the battle front.
     After being injured early in the war, he was transferred to the Military Mounted Police and was attached to the 34th Division when decorated with the French Croix de Guerre.
     He took part in the famous retreat from Mons and also the battle of Marne, Ypres, Aisne and Somme.
AT REUNION.
     Recently Mr Sabin attended a grand reunion of the Old Contemptibles held in London in June.   Among the functions which he attended were a variety show in the Royal Albert Hall and a Jubilee Parade ans service at St. Paul's Cathedral.
     During the Second World War, Mr. Sabin was a member of the English Electric Home Guard and when General de Gaulle visited Stafford and inspected the Home Guard, Mr. Sabin had the honour of personal congratulations from the General on his achievements in France.

MILITARY POLICE - RECORD OF MEDAL PRESENTATION.
     We had pleasure in our last issue in reporting a record parade for the presentation of medals for long service and good conduct, this taking place in the Army Service Corps, when fourteen members of that Corps were so decorated.   Now we have pleasure in placing on record an even more remarkable record, which the members of the Military Police have achieved for no fewer than 20 non-commissioned officers of that corps at one time.   The record is the more remarkable from the fact that the whole strength of the Corps is no more than 500, of whom a good proportion are already in possession of the same devotion.   The following are the names of those who have been the latest recipients of the medal :- Sergeant J Cook, 367, Sergeant.

Extract from the Staffordshire Sentinel 16 April 1917.   ADVENTURE AS A SECRET AGENT,   WITH ALLENBY IN PALESTINE.   INSPECTOR FRED SAUNDERS.
         Incidents in his romantic career - during which he worked as stable boy, footman, police officer and wartime Secret Service Agent. - were related to a ""Sentinel"" representative to-day by Inspector Frederick Saunders, who retired yesterday from the Stoke on Trent City Police Force.
     He joined the Force in 1909 and was the oldest serving member, in length of service.
     A native of Buckinghamshire, Mr. Saunders began working life as a stable boy to a prominent Dorset family and his training here was to serve him well in later years as a police officer and soldier.   For three or four years he served in the indoor staff as a footman, but in 1909 feeling the need for an out of door life, he joined the Police Force of the old Hanley County Borough.
     It was not long before he was attached to the mounted branch and his efficiency here led to his being chosen for mounted duty at many ceremonial parades.
MOUNTED ORDERLY.     In 1913, he was detailed as special mounted orderly to the late King George V., when his Majesty visited the Potteries,   In subsequent years, Mr. Saunders, who was for a long time in charge of the mounted branch, acted as special orderly on numerous other Royal visits to the district, including one of the present King, when he was Duke of York.   He remained in charge of the mounted branch until about three years ago and having charge of the police riding school, trained many young officers for mounted service.
     Immediately on the outbreak of the Great War, Mr. Saunders joined the Military Mounted Police, but his service was very different from that of the ordinary officer.
     Owing to his capability as a horseman, he left England after only three week's training, but before his departure he was again honoured by being detailed as mounted orderly to the late King George.
     Shortly after leaving England, he was promoted to Squadron Sergeant Major and this was made into a permanent rank.   he saw service in the Dardanelles, Salonika and Palestine and worked for the Secret Service in other countries.   He served with the Yeomanry, was in charge of transport work and a standard bearer to such well known Commanders in Chief as Sir Ian Hamilton, Major General Murray and Lord Allenby (then Major-General.)

Extract from the Irish Independent, 5/11/2009;  Soldiers Killed by 'rogue' policeman.
     Five soldiers were shot dead by a British trained Afghan policeman who ""went rogue"" and attacked the inside a military compound.
     Warrant Officer Darren Chant, Sergeant Matthew Telford and Guardsman James Major from the Grenadier Guards died alongside Acting Corporal Steven Boot and Corporal Nicholas Webster-Smith from the Royal Military Police.
     They were killed in Nad-e'Ali district of Helmand Province yesterday.
     The British Ministry of Defence named the men but said no further details would yet be released.
     British troops are thought to be involved in a manhunt for the assassin named by tribal elders as Taliban member Gulbuddin another six British soldiers and two Afghan policemen were wounded in the shooting, which was claimed by the Tailban.
     Last night, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to the soldiers describing their deaths as a ""terrible loss"".   He promised to press on with the strategy of training Afghan soldiers and police.
     Mr Brown said "" It appears that they were targeted because they were engaged in what our enemies fear most - they were mentoring and strengthening Afghan forces to make Afghanistan more secure.""
     The British soldiers had been working at the police check point for about a fortnight, mentoring Afghan National Police officers.   Reports suggested they had taken off their armour and were drinking tea with Afghan colleagues when the policeman opened fire."

ARMY PT PART CAUSE OF DEATH.
Soldier's Heart Failure.
    A verdict of death from natural causes was recorded at Woking, Surrey, today on Army probationer Brian Douglas Frank Osborne, 18, who collapsed and died on Tuesday during a mile endurance run at Inkerman Barracks, Woking.
     His home was at Bedford Road, Northfield, Birmingham and he was in the Royal Corps of Military Police.
     Dr David Hater, pathologist of Harley Street, who examined the body shortly after death, said that he found the cause of death was heart failure due to a sub-acute, rheumatic mitral condition accelerated by physical exercise of moderate severity.
     This rheumatic heart condition would be such that it would not produce symptoms sufficiently severe for the man to report sick.
     The coroner said: "" The circumstances of the disease make it obvious that no blame can attach to those responsible for the supervision of the man during his training or while in the army and it is a death from natural causes.

Investiture by the King.   Nearly 300 Decorations.
   The King held an investiture yesterday at Buckingham Palace and bestowed decorations to nearly three hundred Ladies and Gentlemen.   The occasion was specially interesting as marking the resumption of indoor investitures and the admission of friends of the recipients of honour to witness the ceremony.
     His Majesty wore military uniform , and was attended by Captain Sir Bryan Godfrey-Fausett, the Hon.  Sir Dereck Keppel, the Hon. Henry Stoner, Lt/Gen., Sir Douglas Dawson and other officials.   About four hundred Ladies and Gentlemen assembled in the Ball Room as spectators.   As the King entered and took his place on the Throne Dais, the Guards' Band, stationed in the organ loft at the other end of the apartment played the National Anthem.   A similar compliment was paid when His Majesty retired, and throughout the ceremony the musicians rendered various selections.
     Corporal James Smith of the Military Mounded Police received the Albert Medal.  For a brave endeavour to rescue an entombed Frenchman from a brewery which was on fire and partly wrecked.   The corporal with Major Smith ans Sergeant Gibson, made their attempt in circumstances which threatened almost certain death.

Presentation also reported in the Scotsman 14/11/1919 and the Gloucester Journal 12/7/1919.

Manchester.   Sergeant Major A Stanton who prior to the war was a sergeant in the Manchester Force is now with the MMP in France and has been awarded the MSM  for devotion to duty.   Police Review, 10/11/1916, page 455.
A gallant Manchester Sergeant.   Sergt. Major Stanton, whose portrait appears on this page with those of his wife and daughter is now serving in the Military Police.   He was recently awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for devotion to duty, and has twice been mentioned in despatches.   Sergt. Major Stanton has now been on active service for 18 months, and has been in France for over a year.   On several occasions he has saved the inhabitants of French villages from danger, when under shell fire, and has got them into safety.   Before the war he was a Sergeant in the Manchester Force, in which he has served 16 years.   As a Policeman he received many awards for saving life, and only last December, when home on leave, he was presented with a silver medal for stopping a runaway horse, as reported in our columns at the time.   On this occasion he was instrumental in saving the lives of several school children, and his wife and little daughter have good reason to be proud of their gallant husband and father.

Extract fro Stapleford & Sandiacre News 14/4/1945.
SANIDACRE FAMILY'S PROUD WAR RECORD.
Moving Artillery At Anzio Beach Head During Day Light.
     Both the men folk of the Straw family of 6 Doncaster Avenue, Sandiacre are serving overseas with the Forces.   The father, Mr S Straw is at present with a Royal Army Medical Corps unit in Belgium, and his son Company Quartermaster  Sergeant Syd Straw is with the Provost Section of a famous British Infantry Division in the Mediterranean theatre writes a military observer.
     It was in August 1940 that CQMS Straw enlisted in the Corps of Military Police and he came overseas in March 1942, when his Division played a leading part in the North African campaign.   They later formed the spearhead of the action which captured the island of Pantlaria and after s short time in Naples went to the Anzio Beach-head where they were amongst the first troops ashore.
His Biggest Wartime Job.
     It was in Anzio that CQMS Straw had the biggest job of his wartime career - that of controlling the whole of the division's artillery when it was secretly moved by night from the central sector to the Nettuno front.   The traffic control and guarding of vulnerable points form the main part of the Provost Section's work in the field and during the Italian campaign casualties were very high amongst them.   Cross Roads, Bridges, road diversions and other important points are constantly patrolled by CMP men.
     While acting as regimental sergeant major he was slightly wounded by shrapnel - ""But"" he said ""I'm none the worse for it do-day.""
     In civil life he is employed as a clerk by the Stanton Iron Works Company.

Extract from the Devizes and Wilts Advertiser 24 April 1913.   MAKING FREE WITH WAR OFFICE PROPERTY - A case from Urchfout:  Warning to Campers.
     At Devizes County Magistrates' Office on Friday, before Mr. A Grant-Meek (in the chair) and Mr. D. W. Butler, a member of the gipsy fraternity, named Joseph Light, was brought up in custody charged with camping on War Office land in the parish of Erchfout, without having previously obtained the consent of the General Officer Commanding the Southern Administration.
     It appears to be a practice with the nomadic tribes who travel from fair to fair, to halt on Salisbury Plain and make free with firewood, and to live rent free as long as possible.   In consequence of complaints, the military authorities have taken precautions to prevent this, as far as possible and on Thursday last Corporal Sweet and Corporal Royal, of the Military Mounted Police were on the look out near Pond Farm Camp, which judging by the number of marks of fires having been used, seems to be a popular camping place.   They ""rounded up"" one family, who were en route for Devizes Fair and the sequel was the holding of a magistrates investigation on Friday.
     Corporal Royal, MMP, deposed that on the previous afternoon he received certain information from Corporal Sweet, as the result of which he went to Pond Farm Camp, where found the prisoner, Joseph Light, with a large fire, which he had kindled with wood taken from the trees there.   There were four horses belonging to defendant grazing there.   Witness asked him if he was aware that he was trespassing on War Officer land.   he replies ""Yes."".  There was a small four wheeled van there, as well as the four horses.   Witness obtained the assistance of the police from Erchfout and the man was given into custody.
     The Deputy Clerk (Mr. G. W. Spencer), to defendant: Do you wish to ask this witness any question?
     Defendant: No Sir,    It's quite right what he said.   I had come from Salisbury that day, 16 or 17 miles and I had just stopped to make a fire and get a cup of tea.
     In reply to a question, Corpl. Royal said Erchfout was about two miles from Pond Farm Camp.
     The Chairman (to defendant):  You knew you had not business there.
     Light:  Quite right.   I was only there about an hour, sir.   I am very sorry it happened.   I have never been there before and never had any case against me before.
The Chairman;  Where did you get the wood from to make a large fire?
     Defendant;  I picked it up.   There was plenty lying about there 0brush wood.
     The Corporal said there were a number of fire places about the camping ground.
     Corporal Sweet was in court, but the Bench decided that his evidence was not necessary.
     The Chairman said this custom must be stopped.   There was a heavy penalty and in this case defendant was aware of the byelaws.   he would have to pay a fine of 10s and 11s 6d costs.
     The Chairman;  Now. don't come here again.
     Defendant;  The next time I come on that land, sir, give me a moth's hard labour.
     The Chairman;  You may not get off so lightly as that.
   The money was paid.

THE FINN, VC, MEMORIAL FUND.
     At a meeting of the committee of this fund on Saturday, the suggestion of the East Cornwall Hospital Committee that the fund should be devoted to the provision of an X-Ray outfit for the hospital was favourably considered and it was decided to ask the hospital committee to get some information as to the probable cost.   It was at the same time suggested that one of the cots in the Hospital should still be known as the ""Finn Victoria Cross Cot.""   It was thought however that it would be a decided advantage to the Hospital an therefore the public of the district served, if there were an X-Ray appliance in connection with the institution.
     We have received a letter from Sergt. R Weary, of the Military Mounted Police, BSF., enclosing 1 towards the fund.   He refers to the gallantry of the late Pte. Finn, whose memory, he says, we as true Cornish men should all the more cherish now that he has paid the supreme sacrifice."

In the Division they were controlled by Major E P Wedlake-Lewis the APM, and were comprised about a hundred men under Captain E Clarke's command.   It was their duty to mark the Divisional and Brigade Centre Lines with the Divisional sign on a metal plate bearing an arrow and the number of the formation or unit beneath.

Sergeant Guy Wiggington, of the Military Police formerly a constable in the City Police Force and Police Sergeant Chittenden were commended by the Portsmouth Magistrates (Mr A J Stedman, Mrs H W Pearce and Mr C E Smith) for ""a very smart piece of work"" which led to the capture of a man who had been a deserter from the Royal Artillery since October 1940.
     Gunner John Smith (22), described as of no fixed home, but who had recently been living with a family named Carter, at 7, Hamilton Road, Porchester, was charged with being a deserter from the Army;  with taking away without the permission of the owner, Leonard Carter, a motor van;  with driving it without being the holder of a licence, and without having in force a policy of motor insurance:  with theft of an identity card values 1s:  and with falsely representing that he was Eli Carter, to whom the card related.
     Smith admitted the offences with the exception of those concerning the identity card, stating that ""he only borrowed it for a few minutes.""
     It was stated that Sergt. Wigginton was riding his motorcycle along the Sputhampton Road, Paulsgrove, on Saturday when he saw Smith, in civilian clothes, driving the van towards Cosham.   He recognised him as a deserter.
     After having been questioned Smith made a statement that he was a soldier, but the Carters did not know that, and that he took the van to get a pair of shoes at Cosham.
     John William Carter (1*), son of the owner of the van, charged with abetting Smith to take away the van, was discharged, and when the Chairman announced they had decided to convict Smith on other charges the police did not proceed with a joint charge against Smith and John William Carter for stealing the identity card.
     The Magistrates ordered that Smith should be handed over to a military escort, and imposed fines amounting to %.   He was also disqualified for 12 months from driving a motor vehicle unless required to do so by the Army."

DEATHS IN TRIOS.   Rhine Army Superstition.
Cologne, Wednesday.
     It is a remarkable fact that a sudden death in the Rhine Army is always followed within a space of a fortnight by two other deaths.   This coincidence dates back to the early days of the occupation and old members of the garrison always point to ti.
     The sudden death of Cpl. Kempson, Royal Welch Fusiliers, who fell from a window at Theluvelt Barracks, sustaining frightful injuries has been followed by the death of L/Cpl Waring, military mounted police and the day old son of Sergt. and Mrs. Taylor, RAMC.
     L/Cpl Waring was being treated for a knee injury and underwent a slight operation in the military hospital.   he collapsed when under the anesthetic and despite every effort of the doctors present died within a minute.
     Everything possible was done to revive the unfortunate patient, but, after two hours, the doctors were forced to admit themselves beaten.   It is stated that L/Cpl Waring died from heart failure."

FURIOUS DRIVING.
     At Dover Police Court on Monday, before Messrs: P. W. Jm Mackenzie (in the chair and Mr. Bradley.
     James Berry, a hawker of Eythorne Green was charged with on February 26th furiously driving a pony and art in Limekiln Street.
     Defendant pleaded guilty.
     Mr. Vosper (assistant solicitor to the Town Clerk) prosecuted and stated that defendant was liable to a fine of 40s.
     Corpl. Francis Willis, Military Mounted Police said:  On February 26th, about 7 p.m., I was on dismounted duty in Limekiln Street when I saw the defendant driving a pony and cart in a reckless manner.   The cart was swaying from one side to another and defendant was swaying in his seat.   I  thought that he was drunk.   The street is a very narrow one.   I thought that it was  a runaway at first and I know two men who had to jump out of the way of the horse.   Later I saw Inspector Lockwood at the top of Snargate Street and was telling him about the case when the defendant drove past.   PO.C. Smith took the defendant's name and address in the Marke5t Square.   Defendant appeared to be drunk and the horse was in a sweat as if it had been driven furiously.
     Defendant said the springs of the cart were loose, which caused the cart to sway.  He had only had peppermint that day and was not drunk.
     The Chief Constable said defendant was brought in and was to have been charged for having been drunk and disorderly, but defendant pulled himself together so well that the police gave him the benefit of the doubt and charged him with driving furiously.   Defendant had been before the Court once before for having been drunk and disorderly. 
     The Chairman, in telling the defendant that he would be fined 15s inclusive, advised hi to get the real peppermint next time and to keep to it.   The Bench thanked Corpl. Willis for his assistance in connection with the case.

Extract from the Surrey Advertiser 9 November 1912.   FARNBROUGH.   CODY AND THE COW.   INTERESTING COUNTY COURT ACTION.
     A case of much interest and the first of its kind in this country, was heard at the Farnham County court on Wednesday, when John Maynard, farmer, of Cove, Sued Colonel Cody, the well-known aviator, for 20 damages for the loss of a cow killed by a monoplane  whilst the machine was being driven by the defendant.   Mr. T. L. Jackson for the defendant.
     The evidence for the plaintiff was to the effect that on the evening of the 6th of July last the der43endant was flying across Laffan's Plain and when descending struck a cow belonging to Mr. Maynard.   The cow had its back broken and died soon afterwards.   Plaintiff alleged that the spot on which the monoplane alighted was very boggy and this was borne out by Cpl. Willis, Military Mounted Police, who stated that no aviator would land there voluntarily.   Mark Hamilton, a horse slaughterer, said he sold the carcase of the cow for Dog's meat for 30s, and obtained 19s. for the hide.   he intended to give plaintiff 15s.   Mr. Carpenter, Farmer, Cove said the cow was worth 20 alive.
     Defendant said the place at which he landed was most excellent for the purpose and there was no cow where when he prepared to descent.   On striking the earth he felt no extra shock, but the machine stopped rather abruptly.   He saw the tractor in front crumple up and on looking back he notice a cow lying about 10 to 15 yards.   Mr. Cody alleged that the cow suddenly galloped from the trees and seemed to charge the monoplane.   Captain Reynolds and Captain Derbyshire, both of the Royal Flying Squadrons at Farnborough, gave is as their opinion that the scene of the accident was a very good place for a landing. 
     After legal arguments by Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sullivan.   his honour said he had not doubt that the defendant used all possible care, but his view was that it was not nece3ssary for plaintiff to show that Colonel Cody was guilty of negligence and for this reason, that a person who used a dangerous machine did so at his own risk and peril and was liable for any damage which resulted from the use of such machine, quite apart from any proof of negligence.   He gave judgment, for 18 and costs.
     Mr. E. Jackson asked for leave to appeal, which was granted."

Part of an article ""Killed In Action 22.04.40 By Capt. V L R Dugdale, Royal Signals the son of CSM Dugdale.   See RMP Journal, 3-1966, page 4 for full article.
On the 22/5/1940 my father on his motorcycle was approaching the village of Drionville, situated on the D341 between Boulogne sur Mer and Therouanne, having driven from the direction of Nielles les Blequin via Vaudringhem.   The Germans (possibly leading elements of Rommel's 7 Panzer Division had apparently reached Drionville from Thiembronne heading for Wismes.   Two NCO's namely No. 7683624 Cpl Walter Smith and No. 7683902 L/Cpl John Pepperell Boon, were following my father in a small ""truck"" (15 CWT?).   They were all with 151 Pro Coy (General Gort's HQ and were possibly marking a route to Boulogne where a ship was waiting to embark the Rear HQ of the BEF.
     As my father drove into Drionville he was warned by an inhabitant that the Boche were in the village, but he took no notice (lack of sleep/language/suspicion of 5th Column? and continued on the Rue de Calais towards the crossroads on the D 341 which bisects the village.
     As he was passing 25 Rue de Calais a German machine gunner opened up from the side of the crossroads and struck him with a rapid burst of fire killing him instantly.
     The motorcycle then swerved across the road and my father fell onto the pavement against the wall of 25 Rue de Calais.   The two NCO's were killed by a second long burst at the following vehicle which was outside 16 Rue de Calais.
     When the firing ceased the family crept out to find my father lying dead against the side wall of their house.   The exact place was pointed out to me.   The three men were buried together by the villagers in a 'tent canvas' in a field by the road to Vaudringhem, now known as the 'English Field'
     After the war, they were exhumed, placed in coffins and buried in the churchyard at Vaudringhem in a plot belonging to Mr Jean-Baptiste Evrade, Gendarme, who was on of the three men wo exhumed and carried them on a farm cart to Vaudringhem churchyard.  Mr Evrarde put up a large wooden effigy, Christ on the cross, at the head of my father's grave with his helmet on top, and wooden crosses on the NCO's graves.   he maintained the graves until he died a few years ago.   The then Major Mr Ernes Baillard and Mr Alfred Tellier a road mender, who is still alive, were the other two men who re-buried the three military policemen."

Extract from the Surrey Mirror, 18/9/42.   ARMY VEHICLES IN OXTED COLLISION.   Second fatal accident at same spot in few days, inquest remarks about camber on road.
Remarks about the camber of the Westerham road at Oxted, at a point stated to be the scene of two fatal accidents in a few days, were made at an inquest at the Town hall, Reigate, on Friday, upon Sergt. William Cunnah, age 42, of the Corps of Military Police who died in the County Hospital, Redhill on September 9th the day after his motorcycle had collided with a military car.   The County Coroner (Mr G Wills Taylor gave a verdict of ""Death by misadventure.""   Evidence of identity was given by Lieut H T Lavender, CMP who stated that Cunnah an experienced and capable motor cyclist was riding a Service machine at the time and was on duty.   Answering the Coroner, he said that except under special authority, usually in case of emergency, military vehicles were expected to conform to civilian speed limits.   Brenda Hitchins, Belmont, Westerham road, Oxted, said that at about 6 pm on September 8th she was cutting the hedge outside her house when she noticed a car travelling towards Godstone from the Westerham direction.   She could also hear a motorcycle coming, and saw it for a fraction of a second as it approached from Godstone direction:  it appeared to be on the crest of the road.   She went on cutting and the heard a crash, and turned round to find that the motor cyclist and his machine had parted company and were both coming towards her.  The car drew into the side of the road and pulled up within her view.   She explained that there was bend in the road and that her house was about the centre of the bend.  The cyclist would have a slightly longer view of the road ahead than would the car driver.   She doubted if they could see each other at the moment she saw both of them for the first time.   CORONER ON CRASH HELMETS.  Dr S A Hunter, of the County Hospital, said Cunnah was admitted at 6.45 pm on September 8th, deeply unconscious, and suffering from head injuries and fracture of the right arm, as well as other injuries.   An operation was performed to relieve pressure on the brain, but he died the next morning, death being due to fracture of the skull, multiple injuries and shock.   Lieut Lavender recalled said that Cunnah would be wearing a crash helmet at the time, and the Coroner remarked to Mr E Lovell-Hewitt (who represented the War Department) that he had made representations on a previous case about crash helmets.   He recalled that in peacetime after a number of fatalities in motor cycle racing, the question of the design of crash helmets had been gone into, and following the re-designing of them there had been a decrease in the number of fatalities.   Mr Lovell Hewitt promised to mention the matter to the War Department.   PC Birbeck, who attended at the scene of the accident, described the damage to the tow vehicles, that to the motorcycle being chiefly at the front and offside, while on the car the front offside door handle had been wrenched off and the rear offside mudguard damaged.   A lever on the offside handlebar of the motorcycle had been wrenched out as it it might have caught the car door handle.   Describing the road at the scene, he said the vision of the car driver would extend for 50 to 60 yards, and that of the motorcyclist 60 to 70 yards.   Answering Mr Lovell Hewitt he said there were marks on the road at the scene, but they were mixed up with others made by a fatal accident at the same place two days previously.   A DANGEROUS ROAD.  The Coroner: Is it a dangerous bend?- yes sir.   In reply to Mr Lovell Hewitt, he said the camber at that spot was rather pronounced.   When Mr Lovell Hewitt suggested that it might be better if the road was banked and some of the camber taken out, witness agreed with him.   The driver of the car, Lieut-Col Francis Lane Fox, said it was an Army vehicle, and he was on duty at the time.   He was rounding the bend and saw the motorcyclist coming towards him about 20 yards away.   Witness swung to the left to avoid him;  before swinging away he thought his offside wheel was about on the white line.   It appeared to him that the motorcyclist was unable to swing to his left.   The motorcyclist was going fairly fast, and witness thought possibility he was afraid of the camber and so unable to swing away.   The Coroner; What about your speed? - I recon I was going about 40.   Do you think that a reasonable speed to take this bend? - yes I do.   To further questions by the Coroner Lieut-Col Fox said he thought the handlebar of the motor cycle touched the side of the car as they were passing.   He did not realise at the time that they were in a built up area."

Part of an article ""Killed In Action 22.04.40 By Capt. V L R Dugdale, Royal Signals the son of CSM Dugdale.   See RMP Journal, 3-1966, page 4 for full article.
On the 22/5/1940 my father on his motorcycle was approaching the village of Drionville, situated on the D341 between Boulogne sur Mer and Therouanne, having driven from the direction of Nielles les Blequin via Vaudringhem.   The Germans (possibly leading elements of Rommel's 7 Panzer Division had apparently reached Drionville from Thiembronne heading for Wismes.   Two NCO's namely No. 7683624 Cpl Walter Smith and No. 7683902 L/Cpl John Pepperell Boon, were following my father in a small ""truck"" (15 CWT?).   They were all with 151 Pro Coy (General Gort's HQ and were possibly marking a route to Boulogne where a ship was waiting to embark the Rear HQ of the BEF.
     As my father drove into Drionville he was warned by an inhabitant that the Boche were in the village, but he took no notice (lack of sleep/language/suspicion of 5th Column? and continued on the Rue de Calais towards the crossroads on the D 341 which bisects the village.
     As he was passing 25 Rue de Calais a German machine gunner opened up from the side of the crossroads and struck him with a rapid burst of fire killing him instantly.
     The motorcycle then swerved across the road and my father fell onto the pavement against the wall of 25 Rue de Calais.   The two NCO's were killed by a second long burst at the following vehicle which was outside 16 Rue de Calais.
     When the firing ceased the family crept out to find my father lying dead against the side wall of their house.   The exact place was pointed out to me.   The three men were buried together by the villagers in a 'tent canvas' in a field by the road to Vaudringhem, now known as the 'English Field'
     After the war, they were exhumed, placed in coffins and buried in the churchyard at Vaudringhem in a plot belonging to Mr Jean-Baptiste Evrade, Gendarme, who was on of the three men wo exhumed and carried them on a farm cart to Vaudringhem churchyard.  Mr Evrarde put up a large wooden effigy, Christ on the cross, at the head of my father's grave with his helmet on top, and wooden crosses on the NCO's graves.   He maintained the graves until he died a few years ago.   The then Major Mr Ernes Baillard and Mr Alfred Tellier a road mender, who is still alive, were the other two men who re-buried the three military policemen."

Richard Robert Charles Hager.

Extract from local newspaper.
Military Policeman killed, motorcycle accident on Lingfield-Copthorne Road, questions about road repairs.   Questions about repairs to sections of the Lingfield-Copthorne road near the junction with West Park road, were asked at an inquest at Wallington on Thursday last week on Richard Robert Hagar, a corporal in the Corps of Military Police, who was killed in a road accident on the previous Tuesday.   The County Coroner (Dr. Cyril Baron) sat without a jury and Mr E Lovell Hewitt (Reigate) represented the War Department.   PC Beale said the main surface of the roadway was good, but on the south side there was a 3 ft strip of rough concrete, which was keyed to take a tarmac surface.   At one end of this strip was a hydrant box and stopcock box, which projected one inch above the surface .   The road was 20 feet wide at this point.   Nine months of road repairs.  PS Hills said in places the strip of concrete was two inches above the level of the remainder of the roadway.   There were no warning signs that there might be danger to road users.   The highway authorities had been engaged for nine months on repair work to this road and this was the first accident that had happened.   He was called to the scene of the accident at 2.35 pm on the previous Tuesday.   There were skid marks and cuts in the tarmac measuring 43 yards in length;  these had been caused by the motorcycle ridden by Hager.  CSM Bertram White, CMP said Hager, who was 28 years age, was a corporal in the Corps and his home was at Wandsworth.   He had been in the Army since March, 1932 and had been riding a motorcycle since July last year.   He had ridden continuously since then and was regarded as a safe driver.   At rhe time of the accident he was on patrol duty.   STEERING WOBBLE.   L/Cpl Arthur James Curry  said he was driving an Army lorry towards Newchapel cross roads at 25 miles per hour when a motorcyclist passed about 45 miles an hour after overtaking him the motorcyclist got on to the rough road surface and appeared to develop a wobble in the steering.   He tried to right this, but his machine went over on its side and skidded along the road.   The driver in an oncoming car swerved to the offside but the motor cyclist hit the side of the car.   The rough surface was on the extreme off side and there was no need for the motor cyclist to have gone onto this when passing the lorry.   Sgt Edward Murphy said the machine was on the crown of the road when it started to wobble and the rider appeared to lose control.   Although he did his very best the car driver was unable t, o avoid the collision.   L/Cpl Herbert Crossman another passenger in the lorry also gave evidence.   Lt Reginald Bateman, RE a passenger in the car, said he thought the front wheel of the motorcycle hit the edge of the concrete strip or the stopcock box and the machine bounced away.   The driver tried to turn the machine towards the centre of the road, but got into a terrific wobble, the machine bounced a few more times and then went over.   His driver braked and turned to the raight, and the car was practically at a standstill when the motorcycle hit them   Pte Cyril Thomas Eversfield, RASC driver of the car gave a similar testimony.   An RAMC officer said Hager received a fractured skull and must have been killed instantaneously.   ""Accidental Death"" verdict.   The Coroner said one witness stated the motor cycle wobbled when he was on the crown of the road and the other that he was on or near the concrete strip and it seemed somewhat remarkable this state of things had existed for this length of time.   There were apparently no warning notices of any kind.   He thought it seemed reasonably clear from the evidence that the difficulties which the motor cyclist met with were caused when he hit one of these obstructions.   Never the less, it appeared it was quite unnecessary for him to go on to the part of the road at all he had ample room to pass the lorry.   It was clear neither the lorry driver nor the driver of the car was in the least to blame for what occurred and his verdict would be one of ""Accidental death""."

Extract from Western Gazette, 17/4/42.   SOLDIER CYCLIST'S DEATH, Collision with lorry at Middlemarsh.
An unmarried soldier Pte John Thomas Haugh of the Corps of Military Police age 28 whose home address was given as 78 Bolam Street, Byker, Newcastle upon Tyne, died in hospital at Sherborne following a road accident.   He was riding a pedal cycle and when near the White Horse Inn Middlemarsh, came in collision with a lorry, owned by Messrs. B Tite and Sons of Cerne Abbas and driven by Lewis Harry Coffin, of Pond Farm, Hillfield.   At the inquest on Wednesday morning the Coroner for North Dorset (Mr W H Creech) recorded a verdict of accidental death.   The accident happened at 11 pm and it was stated that the cyclist, who had previously visited the Inn, had no lamps on his machine.   The Coroner said ""He was probably doing what we have all done at some time - risking a ride home without lights in the hope of not meeting the constable, and that was really the cause of the accident.    Ernest Alfred Pitt, Church farm, Hermitage said he went to London with Coffin in a two ton cattle truck.  Just before the accident the speed of the lorry was about 28 mph.   Witness did not see the cyclist, but felt the bump which made Coffin stop.   Coffin found the deceased on the cycle on the grass verge on the right hand side of the road.   The driver of the lorry gave evidence - asked by Police Superintendent Cherrett why he did not see the cyclist, witness replied ""I did not see him at all"" and suggested he might have come across from the ban and have run straight into the lorry.  PC Trevett stationed at Buckland Newton gave evidence that there were  no lamps on the pedal cycle.   The Coroner said he had had no evidence of criminal negligence on the part of the lorry driver, but there was negligence on the part of the deceases, who war riding a cycle in the black-out without lights.   After the hearing the Surgeon Commanders evidence that Haugh at the time of the accident was not  under the influence."

Burial of Dowlais Soldier.   LATE PTE. Wm HUGHES.
     The funeral of Pte Wm Hughes of high Street, Dowlais (a report of whose death will be found on the front page) took place on Tuesday at Pant Cemetery, and large crowds of sympathisers  lined  the route fro his residence.   The family of Private Hughes is well known in the town, his great grandfather being the late Mr William James who carried on a flourishing grocery trade in Union Street during the last century and the beginning of this.
     At the house and graveside the service was conducted by Adjutant March and Songster Leader Hemmings of the Salvation Army.   The coffin was covered with the Union Jack and a company of the Dowlais Home Guard under Sergt. J Clark was in attendance,   Representing the 67th Company, Corps of Military Police, Leicester was Sergt. Kenneth Rowe.    A poignant feature of the tragedy was that the deceased soldier buried his wife 18 months ago and two young boys aged seven and five are now left orphans with their grandmother Mrs Mary Ann Hughes.   Letters of sympathy have been received from his commanding officer and from the Quartermaster Sergeant testifying to the great grief of the Company at the untimely death of an excellent soldier and comrade who was always on duty.

Extract from the Sevenoaks Chronicle and Kentish Advertiser, 6/9/40.
KILLED BY HIS FRIEND.   Revolver accidentally fired in a billet.   That there had undoubtedly there had been a degree of carelessness was the opinion of the Coroner (Mr H Soady) when at Tunbridge Wells on Wednesday he returned a verdict of ""Accidental death by guns shot wounds on Lance Corporal Elliot Ivins of the Corps of Military Police, who was accidentally shot dead by one of his own comrades in his billet at Warwick Park.   Ivins home was in Aldershot.   Sgt A W Mason, of the Corps of Military Police, said he was having his breakfast when he heard a revolver shot and a shout came from upstairs.   L/cpl May came down and the witness told him to telephone for an ambulance.   Ivins was lying on his back on the floor  with a revolver wound in the right eye.   He died on the way to hospital.  Three Lance Corporals and L/Cpl Ward were in the room.   Capt C Wm Chas Baglin, in command of the company said the men were issued with revolvers and ten round of ammunition.   When on duty they were ordered to load six chambers and when they came off duty the unloading was done by the visiting NCO.   A man should not enter his living quarters with a loaded revolver.   The Coroner said ""How did the loaded revolver escape detection? Witness ""By the NCO visiting, who has since been dealt with.""   Lance Corporal R Sinclair, a colleague said he saw Ivins fall to the ground with blood streaming from his face.   Ward had a revolver in his hand, but dropped it and immediately ran out of the room.   Both Ivins and Ward were on the best of terms.   L/Cpl H G Jupp also gave evidence, Sgt T P Moon said that when he asked Ward how it happened he said it was my revolver and pointed to the .45.   Witness could see that the revolver was loaded.   Later witness saw Ward, who said I was cleaning my revolver and we were talking, suddenly it went off.   I came off duty this morning, and my revolver was not unloaded.  L/Cpl H A Ward said he had just come off duty and when he went to clean the revolver he tries to break it, but it was a little stiff.   He cave another wrench and his finger must have accidentally caught the trigger.   He did not realise that it was still loaded until he went to clean it.   He had no intention of discharging it, adding that he was on very friendly terms with Ivins.   Detective Sergeant Nash and Dr R W R Lucas also gave evidence.   In returning his verdict the Coroner said that it was obvious firearms did not go off unexpectedly if they were handled properly and with every care.   It did seem that there had been some lack of care when a man in breaking his revolver got his finger on the trigger.  It was extremely unfortunate that the order as to unloading had not been properly carried out, otherwise the accident would never have occurred.   At the same time he could not help feeling a certain amount of sympathy with L/Cpl Ward."

     In reply to the coroner witness said the injuries were of a crushing nature.
     Lance Corporal Frederick Bazendale, Military Police said that at 10.45 pm on October 3 he was picked by an army lorry at Hyde Park Corner.    He and other military policemen were driven to Brompton Road to be on duty  outside a public house at closing time - 11pm.   There were five men in the lorry with the driver.   
Outside Gooch's the lorry stopped and the driver and deceased who was sitting beside him got down to lover the tailboard.
Pitch Dark.
     ""It was pitch dark."" witness explained ""I saw the cab coming.   It is hard to estimate the distance but it seemed to be about 25 yards away.   I was sitting in the lorry looking over the heads of the men at the tailboard.   I was expecting the cab to turn out o pass us but when it was about 15 yards away I realised that the driver had not seen us.   I shouted ""Look out"" but before deceased and the other man had time to look round the cab hit the lorry.
     The coroner ""Did  the cab speed up as it approached ?   Witness ""No Sir.""
     In reply to Mr Clements, witness said that the tailboard when down did not. obstruct the red light.   It was possible that the light was obscured by on of the was men standing at the tailboard.
Lance Corporal James Rickard, Military Police said he was in the lorry.   he did not see the cab approaching.   There was a crash and he was Flung into the Road.   The only warning h had was a shout of ""Look out'"" just before the crash.
     PC Elliot, 461B said he was called to the accident and found deceased  in the road.   After he had been taken to hospital witness examined the lorry.   the red tail light was glowing through a hole about four inches in diameter in the tailboard.
     Mr Clements Did anyone complain to you that the tail light was not visible.   Witness, No sir.
     Pc Steward, 305B said the cab driver stated"" I was going along Brompton Road at a modest speed when suddenly a few figures loomed up in front of me.   Before I had time to put on my brakes I ran into the men and the lorry.   The men must have been standing in front of the rear lamp because I did not see one.   Only Light Cabman Saw.  The cab driver Robert Edward Haines, 243 Clapham Road, Stockwell said his side lights were dimmed in accordance to regulations.   In Brompton Road he estimated his speed at 15 miles per hour.   ""It may have been a little over, "" he said, ""It was very dark.   The only light I saw was the ""Keep Left sign on the obelisk at the top of Hane Crescent I saw nothing of the soldiers  until I was a yard or two from them.   I applied by brakes but it was too late.   I crashed into the vehicle.
     Coroner ""Was the red light not visible, witness "" Not at all.""
     How did this terrible collision occur ?   His was completely dark there was no indication there was anything in the road.
     In reply to Mr Clements witness said he had been driving for 14 years and had a clean licence.   He had never been prosecuted in respect of any offence.
Coroner and His Duty.   The coroner said that a war time restrictions added a considerable responsibility to to Coroners duties in as much as such cases were now investigated in the absence of a jury.   One of the men standing in front of the lorry may have obscured the tail light said Mr Stafford.   "" I have to decide  whether the cab driver was exercising reasonable care under the circumstances of the black out.   it is not by duty to blame, censure or exonerate.   The verdict will be one of accidental death.
     An expression of sympathy by the coroner with the relatives of deceased was endorsed by Mr C Clements on behalf of the driver of the cab."

Part of an article ""Killed In Action 22.04.40 By Capt. V L R Dugdale, Royal Signals the son of CSM Dugdale.   See RMP Journal, 3-1966, page 4 for full article.
On the 22/5/1940 my father on his motorcycle was approaching the village of Drionville, situated on the D341 between Boulogne sur Mer and Therouanne, having driven from the direction of Nielles les Blequin via Vaudringhem.   The Germans (possibly leading elements of Rommel's 7 Panzer Division had apparently reached Drionville from Thiembronne heading for Wismes.   Two NCO's namely No. 7683624 Cpl Walter Smith and No. 7683902 L/Cpl John Pepperell Boon, were following my father in a small ""truck"" (15 CWT?).   They were all with 151 Pro Coy (General Gort's HQ and were possibly marking a route to Boulogne where a ship was waiting to embark the Rear HQ of the BEF.
     As my father drove into Drionville he was warned by an inhabitant that the Boche were in the village, but he took no notice (lack of sleep/language/suspicion of 5th Column? and continued on the Rue de Calais towards the crossroads on the D 341 which bisects the village.
     As he was passing 25 Rue de Calais a German machine gunner opened up from the side of the crossroads and struck him with a rapid burst of fire killing him instantly.
     The motorcycle then swerved across the road and my father fell onto the pavement against the wall of 25 Rue de Calais.   The two NCO's were killed by a second long burst at the following vehicle which was outside 16 Rue de Calais.
     When the firing ceased the family crept out to find my father lying dead against the side wall of their house.   The exact place was pointed out to me.   The three men were buried together by the villagers in a 'tent canvas' in a field by the road to Vaudringhem, now known as the 'English Field'
     After the war, they were exhumed, placed in coffins and buried in the churchyard at Vaudringhem in a plot belonging to Mr Jean-Baptiste Evrade, Gendarme, who was on of the three men wo exhumed and carried them on a farm cart to Vaudringhem churchyard.  Mr Evrarde put up a large wooden effigy, Christ on the cross, at the head of my father's grave with his helmet on top, and wooden crosses on the NCO's graves.   He maintained the graves until he died a few years ago.   The then Major Mr Ernes Baillard and Mr Alfred Tellier a road mender, who is still alive, were the other two men who re-buried the three military policemen."

Extract from the Chelsea News & General Advertiser, 14/8/42.
DISPATCH RIDER KILLED.   Millbank fatality.   An inquest was held by Mr Bentley Purchase at Westminster Coroner's Court on Wednesday, August 5, on Pte Robert Frank Turner (23) a member of the Corps of Military Police, who collided with a bus and was fatally injured, whilst riding a motor bicycle in Millbank on Bank Holiday.  His brother Herbert William Turner, 141 Wendover Road, stoke Mandeville, Bucks said the deceased had good health, but suffered fro a disease of the eyes which could not be corrected with glasses.   He last saw him a fortnight ago.   He was used to riding a motor bicycle.   His sight had handicapped him at school and accounted for him being in the Military Police.   RQMS James Hayter of the Military Police, said the deceased had been at HQ for about 4 months.   He did ordinary duty until a fortnight ago, when he offered himself as a dispatch rider and was sent to the motoring school for training.   In the witness's view he had perfectly good sight.   On Bank Holiday he was sent to Chelsea Barracks for minor repairs to his motor bicycle.   Bus Passengers Felt a Bump.  Charles Henry Placey of Edric House, Page Street, Westminster a passenger in the bus, said he was sitting in the rear seat on top, just as the bus was coming found into Millbank he felt a bump and looked through the window.   He was the deceased lying at the side of the bus.   Robert Wilson, 3 Olyn Street, Vauxhall said that at 11.50 am he was walking along Millbank almost opposite to where the accident occurred.   The bus was halfway into Millbank and the deceased approached fro Atterbury Street.   There was room for him to go past the bus, but he seemed to sheer out into the middle of the road and ran into it.   He skidded 30 or 40 yards.   Fulham Bus Drivers Evidence. Francis Percival Harris of 62 Stepliendale Road, Fulham was the bus driver said that he saw nothing, he started to turn into Millbank  and after the front wheels of the bus had crossed the white line he heard a screech and saw the deceased passing a lamp post.  He had nearly turned the bus, when the deceased swerved from the nearside to the offside.   The front wheels of the but were 4' to 4'6"" over the white line.  PC Alfred Spiller, No. 436A said he was cycling along Bullinga Street off duty.   He saw the deceased lying near the bus and the motor bicycle was jammed against the side of it.   There clearly would have been room for the deceased to pass behind the bus.   in a statement the driver of the bus said "" I was coming round the corner very slowly.   He was coming very fast.   i heard brakes screeching and he came right into me"".   The skid mark was 30 yards long starting near the kerb and finish at the point of impact with the bus.   Sir Bernard Spilsbury, pathologist, said death was due to a fractured skull, injury to the brain, and haemorrhage around the brain.  The deceased had nothing in the nature of cataracts.   Accident Possibly Due to Deceased's Sight.   The coroner said the deceased was a young man who suffered fro a disease of the eyes.   He joined the Military Police, and his sight might have been the reason he was graded for the Corps.   No one in the Corps of Military Police seemed to know his eyesight had not been good.   He (the coroner) did not know whether the accident was due to his sight, but the possibility must be kept in mind.   At the time of the accident he seemed to have lost his head and to have gone out into the middle of the road and collided with the bus when it was almost stationary.   The accident could have been prevented by the deceased, the bus driver came out in the ordinary way.   There was clearly room for the motor bicycle to pass behind the bus, but he did not do so.   The coroner recorded a verdict of ""Accidental Death""."

Dispatch Rider's Death Crash.
A Corps of Military Police dispatch rider, Pte Albert Walker, aged 34 years, of Sheffield, lost his life in a collision between his motorcycle and a lorry on Groby road, it was stated at a Leicester inquest.
     William Charles Snart, tyre repairer, of Brading road giving evidence under emotional strain, said ""It is just like a film in my mind.   I can't get it out.""
     Snart said a lorry had crossed the other carriage-way into Brading road when Walker riding with his head down crashed into the lorry.
     Smart said he thought Walker did not see the lorry until it was too late.
     Frederick Stanley Ladkin, of St Leonard's road, Leicester, driver of the lorry, said the opposite carriage way was clear when he began to turn across it.   He stopped before he crossed.   The first he knew of the accident was when he felt a bump.
     Coroner: I can't see why you didn't see him.
     Mr B Avens, representing the driver, suggested there was time for the motorcyclist o appear out of the blue when Ladkin was slowing up and crossing the road.
     Recording a verdict of accidental death, the Coroner said there was some evidence of neglect but not, in his opinion amounting to criminal negligence."

GRIM JOB IN COLOGNE - Murderers watched by Scots Guards.
     Two Scots Guardsmen who in Cologne recently had the unenviable job of guarding three German murderers were present at the dramatic court room scene when a Military Court judge pronounced sentence of death upon the three men for the brutal killing of a British CMP last November, writes a military observer.
     Gdsm. William Thompson whose home is 26 Church Place, Grahamston, Falkirk, and Gdsm. Tom Mark of 324 High Street, Newarthill, had to sit watchfully by the side of  the dock with rifles and bayonets in case either the prisoners or their many relatives in the crowded court should cause a disturbance.
     Seven other Germans, charged with assisting in an failing to report the murder, also had to be watched and eventually received from one to five years imprisonment.   At the conclusion of the case the three murderers were hurried into a waiting van while a cordon of German police kept back the crowd.   The Guardsmen went with them to deliver them safely to Klingelputs goal.   Once the scene of Nazi atrocities."

Extract from the Derby Daily Telegraph, 21/6/43.
Life Wasted Through Lack of Care.   ""It is a great pity that such a useful life should have been wasted for the lack of a seconds care""   said the Derby Coroner Mr T h Bishop, recording a verdict of ""Accidental death"" at the inquest on Saturday  into the death of Lance Corporal Cyril Howgate Watson of 51, North Park Street, Dewsbury.. Lance Corporal Watson serving with the Corps of Military Police was fatally injured on Friday afternoon when the motorcycle he was riding was in collision with a Corporation Trolley Bus at the junction of St Thomas's road and Portland Street, Derby.  
Driver Blameless.   The coroner said that the accident was entirely due to Watson's bad riding.   ""It was his fault without any question"" he added ""no blame can be attached to the driver of the Trolley Bus.""   The driver of the bus, John Douglas Strange  of 43 Little Over Lane, Derby said that coming down St Thomas' Lane his speed reached about 15 mph.   He then shut off the current and coasted as he approached the junction.   He was near the corner when he saw the motorcyclist coming at a fair speed.   Broadside Collision.   It seemed obvious that he was not going to stop and he (Strange) braked hard and swerved to the offside.   The motorcycle came across the front of the but and hit it broadside on.   When he got out he found Watson and the motorcycle underneath the front of the bus.   Ignored Halt.   An eye witness Mrs Doreen Williams of 154 St Thomas's Road, Derby said that the motorcyclist did not slacken speed or stop at the halt sign as he approached the junction.    A passenger on the bus Mrs Hanna Pipes, of 218 Station Road, Melbourne also stated that Watson did not reduce speed and ignored the halt sign.   The cause of death was stated to be a fractured skull and injuries to the body."

When the war broke out he was linving at Bennett, Park, Blackheath and placing his services once more at the disposal of his country he re-enlisted and was appointed Corporal of the Military Mounted Police.   In the discharge of his duties Sergeant Bindon contracted a chill, which resulted in double pneumo0nia, from which he died on Thursday last.   The funeral took place on Saturday at Bulford with full military honours and in the presence  of a large gathering of deceased's  comrades and friends, by all of whom he was held in the highest esteem.

FREMINGTON SOLDIER'S SAD DEATH.
     Mrs Cornish, of 12 Gloster Road, Barnstaple, formerly of Fremington, was on Friday officially notified of the death from heat stroke on July 22, of her son, Lance Corporal, Chas. Cornish (formerly of the Devons, and latterly a member of the Military Mounted Police.   Lance Corporal Cornish was apparently in good health when he last wrote home from Kut-el-Amara, the letter being received about six weeks ago;  and the communication from the War Office announcing his death consequently came as a great shock to the bereaved mother and family.
     Lance Corporal Cornish will be remembered as the first volunteer from the parish of Fremington, having ""joined up"" within a fortnight of the outbreak of war and having proceeded to India with the 2/6th Devons in December, 1914.   A little later he had the company of his brother, Pte. Fred Cornish, who has latterly also been in Mesopotamia.

Extract from the West Sussex Gazette 31 December 1914.   HASLEMERE.   SERIOUS MOTOR ACCIDENT.   FATAL INJURIES TO A SOLDIER.   DRIVER ARRESTED FOR MANSLAUGHTER.
     A serious accident took place in Haslemere on Sunday night, when a military picket patrolling Station Road, which is one of the principal streets of the town, was run into by a motor car and Corporal Frederick Giles, one of six men who were knocked down, was so badly hurt that he afterwards died in the Haslemere Cottage Hospital.   The picket consisted of 17 men of the Royal Scots Fusiliers (now in Bramshott camp) under the charge of Sergeant Joseph Murphy, with two members of the Haslemere staff of Military Mounted Police and they were proceeding along the Station Road in the direction of the railway station, when they were run into from behind by a large Wolseley mot car driven by Eric Henry Hades, of Pitfold Farm, Shottermill.   It was about a quarter to eight in the evening when people were returning from church and there were, therefore many witnesses of the occurrence.   The six men waling in the rear were all knocked down and Corporal Giles, who was badly hurt about the head, was taken in the car to the Cottage Hospital, where he was detained, although, after being examined by a doctor, he expressed a with to return home.   He was, however, put to bed and during the night a change was noticed in his condition.   An operation was performed by Drs. Hutchinson and Winstanley, but the man died shortly after four o'clock on Monday morning, death being due to a fracture of the base of the skull.   The other men were all more or less injured and three of them are now in the military hospital at Bramshott.   The driver of the car, Eric Henry Hides, who is the owner of the local garage, was arrested at half past nine on Monday morning and charged with manslaughter.   Later in the day he was conveyed to the police station at Godalming.   The Coroner (Mr. Gilbert White) was communicated with and the inques5t was arranged to take place yesterday (Wednesday)."

DEATH IN THE DARDANELLES - Another Ramsgate man killed.
     The latest among Ramsgate men to give his life for the Empire is William Henry Edgecock, of 36 Belle Vue Road, who died from wounds received while on service at the Dardanelles.
     Corpl. Hedgcock was an old Army man and though forty eight years of age, rejoined the Service early in September of last year.   He was attached to the military Mounted Police and went to the Mediterranean front in June.
     No details as to the nature of his wounds have yet been received and the intimation of her husband's death reached Mrs. Hedgcock this week in the form of a letter from a fellow non-commissioned officer, who, writing under date August 21st, said that his friend Corporal Hedgcock died the previous day, following wounds received in action.
     The deceased soldier was known to a wide circle of friends in Ramsgate.   Prior to re-joining the Forces he was in the service of the Isle of Thanet Electric Tramway and Lighting Company.

A CAPTAIN'S TRIBUTE TO FALLEN RAMSGATE SOLDIER.
    Mrs. Hedgcock, of 36 Belle Vue Road, Ramsgate, has received particulars as to how her husband Corporal W. Hedgcock, died at the Dardanelles.   Mr Hedgcock who was in the Military Mounted Police, was formerly a driver in the employ of the Thanet Tramway Co., and was 48 years of age.
     The details of his death are conveyed in a very sympathetic letter that Mrs. Hedgcock has received from Captain Goodwin Austen, of the Headquarters, 40th Infantry Brigade.
     The Captain writes: ""It is with the deepest sympathy that I write to inform you of the death of your husband, Corporal Hedgcock, who was serving with this Headquarters as a Military Policeman.
     ""He was struck by a stray bullet on August 20th and died on the 4th Instant.   he bore the pain so bravely and like the true, good soldier that he was.""
     ""His death has been a very great blow to me, for a man, who was more anxious and willing to help, more loyal and hard-working, it would be hard to find.   My sincere condolences in your sad loss.
     Mrs. Hedgcock has also received the official intimation from the War Office of her husband's death.
     When reporting Corporals Hedgcock's death in a recent issue it was stated that the soldier when badly wounded, requested Sergeant Rump, of the M.P. to write to his mother.   This, we regret, was a mistake.   It was his wife to whom Corporal Hedgcock wished the sergeant to write..

THE LATE LANCE CORPORAL JOHN HUGHES
     The following appeared in the ""Cefn"" North Wales Chronicle:-
     ""We regret to record the death of Lance Corporal John Hughes, Military Foot Police which took place at the 63rd General Hospital, Salonika, on September 7th, aged 24.   The deceased soldier was the only son of Pte. Wm. Hughes (plasterer), formerly of Cefn, the family now resided in Porthcawl, South Wales.   Lance Corporal Hughes had been on active service over four years.   At the outbreak of war he joined the Glamorganshire RHA, subsequently being transferred to the MFP.   John was a promising young man, full of life and energy, and will be sadly missed by his many friends at Cefn and Porthcawl (where he had worked as plasterer for ten years).   Cefn had a warm place in his heart, where he regularly visited his friends and relatives.   His chaplain has written several letters to his mother and sisters, in which he stated that John had died of wounds.   He was the   of his regiment.
Could w have been there at the hour of your death
To have caught the sigh of your fleeting breath
Your last faint whisper we could have heard
And breathed in your ear one loving word
Only those who are far can tell
The pain in our hearts is not saying ""Farewell.""
And your grave we cannot visit, for it's far across the sea
but as long as life and memory lasts we'll always think of thee.

Extract from the Leeds Mercury 10 February 1915 - LEEDS MAN'S OPTIMISM.
     Writing to his wife at 32, Greenmount Place. Beeston Hill, Leeds, Lance Corporal J. A Jonson, who is serving with the Military Mounted Police attached to the 4th Guards Brigade, says:-
     ""I suppose you will have read all about the second big battle.   I can assure you it was pretty warm while it lasted.   We read the account in the papers dated 26th and 27th; and it was a very good report, too.   Personally, I dare not give you any particulars.   I can only tell you that we are holding the position we captured.
      Talk about bombardments!   The shelling from the big guns was terrific - English, French and German guns - and the rifle fire!   It was like hell.   One continuous fire.""
     "" Ah, well! the Kaiser will remember his birthday.   They tried hard to take a certain town, but failed.   We made lots of German prisoners and from what they say they are glad to get away from the trenches.""
     ""Our chaps behaves splendidly through it all.   The officers of our brigade are gallant men and good leaders and you may be sure they will hold every inch we have gained, and victory will soon be ours.""
     ""Well I must not tell you any more, only that I am still keeping well, and looking forward to the day when we shall all come marching home again, as the song says.""
     ""By the way, I saw three German prisoners with the ribbon of the Iron Cross on their breasts.   I suppose they got it for some of the dirty work which I have too often seen of late.   When we make them prisoners we treat them like human beings.   Believe me, they are glad when we capture them.   They know we treat them well.""
     The above letter, which was written on February 1st, is of particular interest, for on January 20th a man in khaki called upon Mrs. Johnson and told her that her husband had been killed in action.   He incidentally went off with some money and medals belonging to Mrs. Johnson and was subsequently sentenced at Leeds Police Court, to three months hard labour.
     Lance Corporal Johnson, who is a son of the late Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, of the Dragoons, spent several years in the South African Constabulary forces and  served in the South African war in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts.   For his services he was given a lieutenancy.   At the outbreak of war he was employed as a timekeeper at the Queen's Hotel. Leeds.

     Lance Corporal J A Johnson, a Leeds man, who is serving with the Military Mounted Police and after being wounded and suffering from shock is no at a base camp, writes to his wife in the Beeston Hill district as follows
     "" I had it pretty stiff whilst I was a the firing line and had many very narrow escapes.   I had a feeling after that last bombardment at Richbourg L'Avone that if I went into another like it I should not escape so luckily.   Several chaps I spoke to only an hour before it were killed and some others of them have since died of their wounds.l   None of the had any idea that their time was so near.   During the time I spent amongst it I thought several times that I should never come out of it alive.""

Extract from the Belfast News-Letter, 23/3/1915.   POLICE BANDSMAN'S DEATH.
Colonel F Dorling, Provost Marshal, Aldershot, has sent the following statement to the City Commissioner (Mr T J Smith, JP)  in connection with the death of Lance corporal Patrick Smyth, of the Military Foot Police in France, who was formerly a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary Belfast Band:- ""No. 367, Patrick Smyth, Lance Corporal of the Military Foot Police was one of a small detachment working under me at the railway station  
of Laigle (Orne), when he met with a fatal accident at about 2.30 pm on 15th February, 1915.   He had gone across the railway siding to get boiling water for tea, and on his way back, instead of going round some trucks that were being shunted, he passed between tow which were about a yard apart, apparently without noticing the engine at the end of the trucks.   As he passed through the trucks came together suddenly, and pinned him between the buffers.   His death was practically instantaneous, for within ten minutes the French doctor, summoned by telephone, had pronounced life to be extinct.   He was taken to the Hospice Civil, and lay in the mortuary there until the burial, which took place at 3 pm.   Being a Roman Catholic, he received the full rites of burial of that faith.   A detachment of French soldiers posted at the station, a large number of the employees there, three of his English comrades, as well as my self, the officers of the Commission Militaire de Gare de L aigle, the Mayor, and some two hundred of the inhabitants of the small town, paid there last token of respects to a soldier who died in his country's service by following the remains to their last resting place, and many were the wreaths and floral tributes which were placed on the grave.   The coffin was covered with the French Tricolour and union Jack, with his greatcoat spread above.   At the graveside the Mayor and the senior french officer present both addressed the mourners, lamenting the sad accident, and in a few words paid their respect and gratitude to a man who had given his life for the cause of freedom, patriotism, and equity.   The cemetery is situated close to the little township, and the grave is amongst many others of men who have laid down their lives in their country's service.   It can easily be identified and will be marked with a wooden cross pending other arrangements.   (Signed) Arthur B Cowburn. Captain."

MILITARY POLICE - RECORD OF MEDAL PRESENTATION.
     We had pleasure in our last issue in reporting a record parade for the presentation of medals for long service and good conduct, this taking place in the Army Service Corps, when fourteen members of that Corps were so decorated.   Now we have pleasure in placing on record an even more remarkable record, which the members of the Military Police have achieved for no fewer than 20 non-commissioned officers of that corps at one time.   The record is the more remarkable from the fact that the whole strength of the Corps is no more than 500, of whom a good proportion are already in possession of the same devotion.   The following are the names of those who have been the latest recipients of the medal :- Sergeant J Cook, 367, Sergeant. C H Dale, 377, Sergeant A Burrill, 407, Sergeant E Baldwin, 414, Sergeant F West, 419,  Corporal J Savage, 368, Lance Corporal H W Freeman, 501, Lance Corporal W Thorndyke, 522, Lance Corporal J H Salter, 633, Lance Corporal J Finch, 629, Military Mounted Police;  Sergeant W Barrett,494, Sergeant W Howard, 501, Sergeant W Vernon, 502, Sergeant W Weaver, 503, Sergeant J Alder, 529 and Sergeant E A Siddle, 597, Corporal A E Alliston, 596, Lance Corporal H E Richardson, 861, Lance Corporal R L Handley, 675, Lancer Corporal A H Downton, 990, Military Foot Police.
     Of these, six are doing duty in Aldershot and they were presented with their medals by Major J W M Wood, MVO, the Provost Marshal.

SOLDIER AND SWEETHEART:  CLAIM FOR THE RETURN OF PRESENTS.
     Corporal William Thorndike (Thorndyke), of the Military Mounted Police, stationed as Shorncliffe, sued Miss Nellie Thompson, in the service of the Daily Supply Company, South Farnborough, at Farnborough County Court, for the return of money and article handed to her by the plaintiff at a time when they were engaged.
     The plaintiff wore a number of medals.   His counsel said the young woman was ambitious;  she preferred a soldier of higher rank than the plaintiff and transferred her affections to a sergeant.   During their courtship the plaintiff made her presents to the value of over 20 and also deposited with her, towards the furnishings of their prospective home, a number of articles and 10 in money.   it was for the latter that the claim was brought.,   The articles included things he had collec6ted during his service in India, Egypt and South Africa.
     His Honour Judge Harington, after hearing both sides, gave judgement for 6.

At the Sheffield Coroner's Court, yesterday, an inquest was held on the body of Lance Corporal Allan Todd, of the Military Foot Police who died at the Sheffield Base Hospital on Sunday morning as the result of a bicycle accident on Friday night, when he was thrown from his machine on the Tuxford Road, Worksop, and sustained a fracture of the base of the skull.   He never regained consciousness after his fall, and as the accident occurred late at night (about 10.45) and two comrades cycling with him were in front, no one actually saw how the accident happened.   A verdict was returned to the effect that deceased died from fracture of the skull due to a bicycle accident."

BLACKPOOL CONSTABLE'S ADVICE TO WAR'S CRITICS.  
     PC Warwick of the Blackpool Police Force, who went out to France in February for Military Mounted Police duty has written to PS Wilson, under date July 22nd.   He writes that he is is still ""at large"" and feeling very well indeed;  in fact, the simple life suits him.
     ""Taking things all round the hardships, "" he states, ""are scarcely so hard as South Africa.   I have seen a glowing account of the charge of the 8th Irish.   I have seen one or two of the battalion and I am glad that those men who hail from Blackpool upheld the honour of the town.   I went to a certain village with the intention of doing something at the grave of one our our sergeants, but I was interrupted and had to leave rather hurriedly.   It is very hot at present and the flies are a pest by day and at night we are worried by mosquitos.   The French policeman knows how to do it.   He is always on the alert and doss point duty on a chair accompanied by his inseparable cigarette and reading ""Le Petit Journal,"" and if the news is not interesting he may indulge in a short nap.   What do you think of the Welsh coal strike.   I wonder if it would make any difference if they knew  what nice things the troops here say about them?   Just fancy boys and woman here working in the coal mines for 10d and 1s a day!  Well, we don's seem to be doing much do we?  But ""Come out and see.""

Extract from Leamington Spa Courier, 4/8/44.
The sign of the local paper of our home town when we are out in the world, often causes or cures a fit of home-sickness.   Many Leamingtonians are restless when on holiday unless they have the ""Courier"" sent on to them.   Few, however can have managed to get hold of an old ""Courier"" in such an odd way as did Mr Reg Bayliss, son of the later Mr E J Bayliss, JP.   At present he is in Normandy ""on business.""   Having landed on the beach head the day after the initial assault as a member of the Corps of Military Police.   Writing from ""beyond Caen"" to a friend on the staff of the ""Courier,"" he says:  ""The padre  was walking by with a rolled-up paper in his hand the other day, and to my surprise I recognised the old ""Courier,""   Much to his surprise I asked him if it was not the ""Courier,"" for he could not understand how it was possible to tell what paper it was, rolled up like that.   however, he told me he had picked it up on his way round and was going to put it in the rest room but he gave it to me instead."

Extract from the Scotsman, 7/2/1921.   Another Dublin Tragedy.  Military Foot Police Shot Dead.
Old Gloucester Place, Dublin, was the scene of a startling tragedy on Saturday morning, when John Ryan, a member of the military foot police. was shot dead there at 10.30.   Ryan went into a licensed house across the street from his own residence and while having refreshment he was shot.   Ryan was accompanied by his brother-in-law, and it is asserted that three men entered the house, and one of them cried out, ""That's him"" and ""hands Up.""   Shots at point blank range were fired.   Ryan fell at once and bled profusely from a wound in the head, and when he was taken to Jervis Street Hospital in the Corporation ambulance, life was pronounced extinct.   The whole thing happened with such startling suddenness that the assailants got away before the alarm could be raised.  Ryan who was about 48 years of age, had had a long service in the Army, and subsequent to fighting in the late war he was engaged in plain clothes Army duty in Dublin .

With the news, received by |Mrs Lee, Thurlaston, that her husband, Mr Alfred Lee, of the Corps of Military Police, is a prisoner of war in Germany, it is now established that all the missing soldiers of the Dunchurch and Thurlaston district are safe.   Mrs Lee, heard on Friday, by postcard, that her husband is ""still well,"" indicating that he had probably written previously.   As this was the first communication she had received from him since the Dunkirk evacuation, friends have heartily congratulated the family on the news, for, in the long silence, it had been feared that he had been killed.   Son of Mr and Mrs T Lee, halfway houses, Dunchurch, he was an AA Scout before the war and immediately joined up in the Military Police.   The last the family heard of him was that he had been seen riding his motorcycle at Dunkirk during the BEF evacuation ."

     Trained at the Guards Depot, Caterham in 1939, Sergeant R McQuitty of 10 Albert Road, Carrickfergus, is now in the Corps of Royal Military Police stationed in Palestine.
   ""I have had a very interesting life in the Military Police since I joined them in 1942."" he said in an interview with a Military Observe.   ""My most exciting time was when I was stationed in Ismalia last year.   Quite accidentally I came into contact with some men who were in the habit of smuggling hashish and opium across the border into Palestine.   After several days of gaining their confidence they 'persuaded' a friend of mine and myself to take a load of hashish across the border.   We laid a trap for them which resulted in the capture of hashish and opium valued at 70,000.
     ""We were running the risk of dealing with men who could not have hesitated to shoot us had they fot the wind of our trap.   However, it is all part of the job of the Military Police.   Soon after that incident, in May, 1946 I was posted to the 1st Division Provost Company stationed in Palestine.   So far smugglers have kept out of my area.""
     Before joining the Army Sergeant McQuitty was a brick-maker, and although he is due out of the Army in April, 1948 he is considering signing on for a further period in the Corps of Military Police."

Extract from the Newmarket Journal 5 April 1947.   NEWMARKET MAN'S DESERT PATROL.   S.S.M. DAY IN ACTION.
     It is amazing how many Newmarket serving men have, one way and another, combined their service with a closer contact with horses.   Although coming from the home of racing maybe it is not so extraordinary.
     This excellent action photography despatched from the Middle East by a military observer, shows Staff Sergt - Major Reginal Day, son of Mr, and the late Mrs. Day of Arravale Cottage, Park Lane, Newmarket, one of fourteen horsed under his care in the Mounted Military Police.
     A regular soldier, his love for horses took him to the Canal Zone of Egypt on patrols in the vicinity of the new General Headquarters, middle East Land Forces.
     For four years he has been in the Mounted Military Police and has taken part in patrol work in Palestine, at Jerusalem and Sarafand.
     To a military observer, S.S.M. Day described his duties.   ""Mt detachment keeps a constant security patrol in the Headquarters area and around a nearby ammunition dump.   We are kept informed of any thefts of W.D property in our area and we generally recover it in a very short while.
   S.S.M Day finds the most profitable time to send out his patrols is in the early light.  He spends much of his time visiting them for information and investigating any cases of theft reported to him.
     ""Recently thieves broke into the laboratories in the ammunition dump an stole some valuable research instruments,"" he said,   ""By following tracks in the sand we soon located their hiding place in a wheat field not far from the canal.""
     Most of the horses under his care are English bred, ex Cavalry horses.   They take to the desert very well although they cannot be worked as hard as in England.
(Article has a photograph of SSM Day on his horse charging the camera with his sword pointing at the camera.)"

Extract from the Leeds Mercury 10 June 1915.
FINE WORK IN THE FACE OF DIFFICULTIES.
     Corporal Frank Miles, of the Military Mounted Police, on the Gallipoli Peninsular, writing to a friend at Bramley, says:-  ""We had a very stiff job, as the Turks were very strongly entrenched on both the beach and cliffs, but our fellows went at them like mad horses and eventually drove them inland.   They made a very determined attempt to capture the lost ground, but we successfully held them at bay and a very good job we did so, as it was a case of being between the devil and the deep blue sea.
   Since then we have been gradually working our way forward, although we have had one or tow very hard battles, but there has been a continuous bombardment on both sides and as I write shrapnel bullets are flying around.""

Extract from the Skyrack Courier 4 February 1916.  BURTON SALMON D.C.M. HERO.   ONE OF FIVE PATRIOTIC SONS.
     The report circulated recently that Private Thos. Alexander Bailiff, of the 3/1 Hertfordshire Regiment, third son of Mr Jno. Bailiff, of Poole, Burton Salmon, had won the coveted honour of the Distinguished Conduct Medal. has been officially verified in the Battalion Order for January 18th of Bailiff's regiment, a copy of which he has sent to his parents.
     Private Bailiff's brave act, which brought him the D.C.M., was that of saving an officer of the Irish Guards, or, in his own words:- ""Going out for a wounded officer after the battle of Festubert, on May 18th las.""   Private Bailiff is in his 23rd year.   He served his apprenticeship to gardening at Byram Hall Gardens (his father is forester) under Mr. Geo. Taylor;  next he worked under Mr. Geo. Summers at Sandbeck, the Earl of Scarborough's residence;  and when war broke out he was gardener at Hatfield House Gardens, the residence of Lord Salisbury.   He joined the 1st Herts. Regiment and went to the front early in November, 1914, was invalided home after a serious illness last summer and is now back at duty with another battalion of his regiment in Herts.   He is to be married to a Kilburn young lady on the 19th.
     Mr and Mrs Bailiff are very proud of their son's gallant conduct;  and so are also his numerous friends in the hamlet of Poole, Burton Salmon.   Lady Ramsden, wife of Sir John Frenchville Ramsden, of Byram Park, take a kindly interest in Mr Bailiff and his family and especially in their hero.  In letters written by her dated the 20th and 24th January respectively, her Ladyship says how very pleased she was to hear that Thomas had been awarded the D.C.M sends congratulations and says how proud they must all be of him.   Her Ladyship mentions also that Sir John was one of the rearguard who left Gallipoli Peninsula, adding: ""All went well with the arrangements and the weather, otherwis4 might have had a most dangerous time.   He is now in Egypt and is very well indeed.""   Lady Ramsden mentions that a parcel has been kindly sent by the people of Brotherton to Sir John, but she thinks he will not get it, as it would arrive about the time he left Gallipoli.   Private Thos. Bailiff, D.C.M., writing his parents, tell with evident pleasure of the ""long chat"" he had with Lord and Lady Salisbury, who invited him to meet them.
     There are three other sons serving in the Army.   The eldest is Corporal Jno. Kelly Bailiff, of the Military Mounted Police, who is expected home from the Front shortly.   He has a wife and child living at Monk F5ryston.   The second son is Mr. Jas. Hy. Bailiff, gamekeeper for Mr St. John Durnford, Loversall, near Doncaster, who is in group six of Lord Derby's Scheme; the fourth and fifth brothers are Private Richard (dick) and Private Robert Victor Bailiff, who together joined the Scots Greys in May last. but transferred to the 6th K.O.Y.L.I.   Both have been to the Front.   Richard was severely wounded with shrapnel, recovered and has now gone back, and Victor is convalescent at Dovertown Scotland.

MILITARY POLICE - RECORD OF MEDAL PRESENTATION.
     We had pleasure in our last issue in reporting a record parade for the presentation of medals for long service and good conduct, this taking place in the Army Service Corps, when fourteen members of that Corps were so decorated.   Now we have pleasure in placing on record an even more remarkable record, which the members of the Military Police have achieved for no fewer than 20 non-commissioned officers of that corps at one time.   The record is the more remarkable from the fact that the whole strength of the Corps is no more than 500, of whom a good proportion are already in possession of the same devotion.   The following are the names of those who have been the latest recipients of the medal :- Sergeant J Cook, 367, Sergeant. C H Dale, 377, Sergeant A Burrill, 407, Sergeant E Baldwin, 414, Sergeant F West, 419,  Corporal J Savage, 368, Lance Corporal H W Freeman, 501, Lance Corporal W Thorndyke, 522, Lance Corporal J H Salter, 633, Lance Corporal J Finch, 629, Military Mounted Police;  Sergeant W Barrett,494, Sergeant W Howard, 501, Sergeant W Vernon, 502, Sergeant W Weaver, 503, Sergeant J Alder, 529 and Sergeant E A Siddle, 597, Corporal A E Alliston, 596, Lance Corporal H E Richardson, 861, Lance Corporal R L Handley, 675, Lancer Corporal A H Downton, 990, Military Foot Police.

MILITARY POLICE - RECORD OF MEDAL PRESENTATION.
     We had pleasure in our last issue in reporting a record parade for the presentation of medals for long service and good conduct, this taking place in the Army Service Corps, when fourteen members of that Corps were so decorated.   Now we have pleasure in placing on record an even more remarkable record, which the members of the Military Police have achieved for no fewer than 20 non-commissioned officers of that corps at one time.   The record is the more remarkable from the fact that the whole strength of the Corps is no more than 500, of whom a good proportion are already in possession of the same devotion.   The following are the names of those who have been the latest recipients of the medal :- Sergeant J Cook, 367, Sergeant.
