BEF.   France & Flanders
Near ST TROND on the 11 May 1940 this NCO showed conspicuous bravery when bringing back a report from a Belgian HQ during a heavy German bombing attack.   His motorcycle was damaged by an enemy bomb and he repaired his machine while still under fire and succeeded in delivering his report in spite of the fact that he had to pass through an area already occupied by the enemy.

At about 1400hrs on 8 June Sergeant Joualt on a motorcycle went to FORGES-LES-EAUX to find and bring back another FSP (Field Security Policeman) who he knew was on duty at this place, but ran into a column of German tanks and was captured.   French guns opened fire on the column and Sergeant Joualt escaped during the confusion, only to be re-captured half an hour later.   He had by this time obtained civilian clothes at a deserted farm.   He was taken to a village south of BUCHY to await escort.   At 1730hrs he again escaped and rejoined his section in the early hours of 9 June, bringing back valuable information as to the enemy's strength.   Sergeant Joualt acted throughout with complete disregard of personal safety and his only thought was to bring in a man of his section.

At Dunkirk on Saturday, 1st June 1940, after being engaged for three days and nights in embarkation duties at Bray Dunes during continuous heavy bombing and shelling, this WO volunteered to assist in the removal of wounded and was employed on this duty on the Mole, frequently under shell fire, until he was ordered to embark at 2100 hours whereas he could have left at 1000 hours that day.
During the whole withdrawal period and whilst under heavy bombing  and shelling he carried out reconnaisance, traffic and embarkation duties with ability.   By his coolness and devotion to duty he set a fine example to the men under him and contributed greatly to the successful withdrawal and embarkation of BEF troops.

In the early hours of 2 June 1940 Sergeants Naish and Corbett were on the mole at Dunkirk with a large number of men of various units under heavy shell fire.   As ships were not immediately available it was necessary to clear the mole before daybreak as otherwise heavy casualties might have ensued through air and artillery bombardment.   These two NCO's set a great example by their courage and coolness and regardless of their personal safety persuaded many men to march back to the beach from the mole.

Whilst under considerable aerial bombing at ACHICOURT this NCO commanded his section of Military Police which had been armed with rifles and anti-tank rifles for the defence of ARRAS.   With great coolness, courage and ability he afterwards rendered valuable service at ARRAS when Petre Force was withdrawn.

On 23 May 1940 at Douain he showed great coolness and courage in the face of enemy tanks and air attacks, having been forced with 2 other men to take cover in a building from enemy tanks he decided to  fetch assistance.   Under heavy fire he recovered his motor cycle from a ditch and rode to a nearby brick kiln where he expected to find our troops.   Failing to find them he rode back and conveyed the other two men in turn on the pillion of his motorcycle to a place of safety from which they later rejoined our troops.   All this was done under continuous fire.

CAPTURE I was taken prisoner at CALAIS when that town was taken by the Germans.   After being rounded up we were taken to GUISNES, and, on May 28th, I managed to slip out of the column of prisoners into a wood with a French officer, with whom I spent two weeks in the vicinity.,
ESCAPE After that we made our way South through ABBEVILLE, LE TREPORT, DIEPPE, ST. VALERY, BALSEC, LE HAVRE, QUILEBEUF (where we stole two bicycles) PONT ANDEMAR, MAYENDCE, NANTES (here there were A.A.guns on all the bridges, PARTEMAY, PERIGUEUX and CANTMERIE where the French officer left me.   At STELLA PLAGE near St. VALERY a driver in the R.A.S.C. who had joined me helped me to make a raft out of a bathing machine and some wire which we cut out of a German telephone line.   We launched this but the incoming tide prevented us from getting away from the shore.   At CEVRAY I crossed into unoccupied France, walking past the German post, clearly indicated by a large Swastika flag.   I decided to make for SPAIN and got across the Pyrenees and down to the Spanish Village of TORLA, but was here arrested by Spanish guards who took me back to GAVARNIE in France.   I was later taken to ST. GIRONS and spent three days in the town jail before going on to the concentration camp at MONDERRAN-SAVES.   After a month I again managed to get away.   I reached the coast at SE???  And got on a ship bound for ORAN, but I was discovered before the boat sailed and 'kicked' off.   I then went on to MARSEILLES, and, after six days with the Rev. Caskie at the Sailors Mission, boarded another ship disguised as a ship-wrecked sailor.   On arrival at ORAN I was sent up to the D.I.N., where I joined other British personnel and received good treatment.   I stayed there a week and then escaped in the company of a small party of demobilised Legionnaires for CASABLANCA, which was reached on October 5th.   At CASABLANCA with Major Potts and 11 O.R.'s,  through the agency of Mr Bullen, Manager of the Vacuum Oil Company in that town.   We were given the opportunity to embark on the ""MAR ASUL"" A Portuegese ship of about 300 tons.   A friend of Mr Bullen's by the name of Hands, owned a house on the hill-side overlooking the docks, and, from one of the windows of the top story, we could make out the ""MAR ASUL"" lying along side the quay.   Mr Bullen explained that it was up to each individual to make his own arrangements for getting on board.   The dock area itself was surrounded by barbed wire, the two top strands were electrified.   Three of the party (including myself) managed to crawl under this wire at night-time and the others came through the following day, at intervals by a small gate.   I understood from Mr Bullen that the Captain of the ""MAR ASUL"" received the sum of 5,000 Frs. Per head for smuggling us out of CASABLANCA,   He had made arrangements on board for hiding us in part of the front hatch, which was boarded off, and which we reached through a trap door cut in the floor of the crew's quarters.   The vessel was searched before and after sailing but no one was discovered.   Mr NATELER acted as intermediary between Mr Bullen and our party as, of course, it was extremely dangerous to be seen discussing plans.   I was given to understand that a B.B.C. broadcast made by three British soldier, Ptes. Kemp, Wilson and Macdonald, gave the Germans warning of the number of escapers making their way through Spain, and was instrumental in closing the frontier when the Poles had arranged to smuggle men over.   Ptes  C?????  And Sw??? (of the Royal Corps of Signals) who were in our party, against the advice of the rest of us, gave their stories to a representative of the ""Daily Express"" at Gibraltar and also met a representative of the B.B.C. there.   I consider that both these men should be watched as they have no scruples about publishing their experiences.

On 1 July, with other wounded, I was moved, in a lorry through Hesdin, Lille (2 July) and Renaix (4 July) to Loekeren (6 July), where we were packed like sardines in barges and, after 3 days reached Emmerich.   We were then taken on to Dortmund.   While I was there 7 Irishmen and 4 Welshmen were interviewed by a German official in the presence of an individual who bore, on the lapel of his coat, a badge with the letters IRA.   None of the men interviewed subscribed to these efforts to win him over and all of them rejoined us.
By this time I was convalescent and on about 16 July was taken by rail, a 4 days' journey, to Thorn (Poland), Stalag XXA.
After a fortnight I was transferred to a working camp (No354) at Pischnitz (Popolaska) also known as Hoch Stublau.   This camp was about 50km south east of Danzig and prisoners were employed on roadwork on a new road which is to run from Berlin to Danzig.   Although an NCO I was compelled to work, but prisoners who were unfit, at the instigation of a British Medical Officer Major Tucker, RAMC were excused from this levy.   This officer did magnificent work in attending to sick prisoners, although he had little equipment and constant hindrance.
By contrast at Thorn, RSM Davidson (the camp leader) and a Private Puttinger (who wore the crown of a Sergeant Major) curried favour with the Germans and were very harsh with prisoners.   Similarily, CSM Dean, at the working camp, insisted on our working, to the limit of our capacity, in order to placate and win personal favour from the Camp Commandant.
The guards at both camps could be divided into two categories, those who were over 25, who treated us fairly and those who were younger and brutal.   As far as I know no guard would accept a bribe.
While I was a prisoner at Pischnitz (4 August - 17 September 1940) we received a parcel on 28 August, which was divided between 41 men; my portion being 12 cigarettes and half a tin of kippers.   Camp rations were poor; we had two meals a day.   All money and valuables were confiscated.   Each man was given one blanket and all overcoats and spare clothes were taken from us.   There was no issue of soap or towels, so that we were generally lousy and filthy.
The first requisite for escaping is a large scale map of the vicinity of the camp.   I was able to make a copy of a map, which had been brought into the camp by some white Russians who were awaiting repatriation.   Poles came into the camp and worked alongside us on the road.   They did not give us any escape materials but were practically to a man, willing to help escapers.
On the 17 September 1941, 20 of us were out working under one guard.   We were digging up bombs, made of iron and concrete.   The guard left us and we remained under the charge of a German Pole.  Myself , Lance Corporal Green and Gunner Clark seized our opportunity and slipped away and, once out of sight, made off in an easterly direction.   (I was wearing a Polish Uniform, Green had a Polish tunic and British army trousers and Gunner Clark was in battledress.)
Our course was Gostynin, Borazanov and Kenpa.
At Kenpa I was parted from the other two as the Poles thought it better to split us up.
On about 1 October 1941, I was guided by way of Sochechiev to Warsaw, where I was sheltered and looked after by the official Polish organisation.   Later I was taken by train to the Russian frontier, passing through Siedlice and Nemmoijki.   I crossed the river Bug in a boat, while Polish scouts kept a watch for any German patrol.   I climbed over the barbed wire fence into Russia and handed myself over to the authorities within five minutes of crossing the frontier.   I was searched very thoroughly and everything was taken away from me.   I was put in a small cell for one night.   I was taken on to another place ( I did not know the name) and stayed there for 10 days in company with Polish prisoners.   The food was terrible and the conditions were extremely bad.   There was no room to lie down in the cell at night.   I then went to Minsk where conditions were just as bad.   On the 6th January I was sent to Moscow where the conditions were better.   I was in a room with 25 English and French.   The food was good and cigarettes were provided.
While I was at Minsk I had leant two Russian sentences.  'I must speak to the prison governor.' and 'When can I speak to the prison governor?'  which I used in the Moscow prison but with no result.   With me at this time were: Lovegrove, Briggs, Bateman, Boughton.
We were given paper to write to England, but I did not avail myself of this opportunity as I thought the letters would not be sent.   In order to force the Russians to allow us to see the Governor we went on a hunger strike for five days.   On the third day of this strike I was taken away and put in a cell by myself as I was considered to be the ring-leader.   At the end of the five days my friends were moved to another room where I joined them.   This was about the 6th  February.   Three or four days later my friends were taken away and from then on I did not know anything about them.   The following day I was taken from my cell and put in another room with three Frenchmen.   I stayed there until about the 25 February when I was taken out and put in a cell alone.   I was there for five weeks and, at the end of the time, was beaten up by the prison guards,   During this period I was perpetually interrogated and asked why I had come to Russia and also questioned concerning the Secret Police organization in England.   I told them the story of my escape and asked to see the British consul.   I stayed another nine weeks alone in the cell, during which time I was again beaten up.   The Russian-German war then broke out and we were taken to Capatob to a very bad prison; 10 men were packed into one small cell and there was scarcely room to stand.   I stayed there until the 7th  September, when the deputy governor came to my cell and brought me out.   I was then placed in the first class part of the prison and given cigarettes and all the food I could eat.   My clothes were washed and they made a great fuss of me.   The following morning I was taken to Moscow under escort of two Lieutenants.   I stayed in the Lubianka prison for one night where I was extremely badly treated.   The following morning I was taken back to my old prison, but put in a third class part where I stayed alone in a cell for three weeks.   They then came and gave me a bath, haircut etc., but refused to give me any food.   They then took me before two civilians who questioned me as to my name, etc. and then told me I was free.   I asked for some food and this was brought immediately.   They told me the address of the British Embassy but as I did not know my way about Moscow they had to take me there in a car.   They pointed out the Embassy to me and then stopped the car 300 yards away from it.   I rushed straight in.
During the period I was in prison I was forced to sign certain documents in Russian which, naturally, I could not understand.   A revolver was used in order to persuade me to do this.
On board HMS London a full account of my experience was taken down in shorthand under instructions from either Lord Beaverbrook or Lt General Ismay, in Lord Beaverbrook's cabin.   It took about two hours.  I told them the story of my escape with particular emphasis on my experiences in Russia.   I mentioned the name of a Pole who had helped me but was immediately warned by General Ismay that I must, on no account, mention names.

On the 8  August 1944 in the area of MOUNT PINCON, Private Jeffrey was a member of a patrol which was being sniped at from three different directions.   After the patrol had passed back the information Private Jeffreys accompanied the patrol leader going out again to deal with the snipers.
Private Jeffrey under the covering fire of his section commander stalked forward and killed the two snipers nearest to him.   The third sniper made off.   Private Jeffrey then saw a movement to his right flank and crawled to the rear of some enemy and single handed captured three prisoners.

Escape and evasion North Africa
Sgt. ARMSTRONG escaped from the P/W cage at BERKA BARRACKS near BENGASI on 4th December at 1900hrs, with L/Cpl CAIRD, 2/Camerons and Dvr. MURRAY.   Escape was prepared by cutting the wire on the 3rd - all except the last two strands - making final getaway during the changing of the guard on the 4th.
     The three had made several individual attempts to escape previously, Sgt. ARMSTRONG getting as far as MECHILI on one occasion.   They had also prepared an escape jointly by digging a hole through the wall.   They were  betrayed  thought  and the German military police came in, found the hole and, after a search, all their stores of food.   They had saved up 5 tins of sardines, some tongue, a small quantity of rice and macaroni, one Italian loaf, 2 tins of cheese and 5 water bottles.
     When they escaped eventually, they walked right through the barracks, waited for the moon to come up and started off   S.W. of BENINA, walking past REGIMA towards TEONIS.   On the 12.12.41 they met an Arab between MARAUA and SLONTA, who was a great help to them and guided them on their journey were finally picked up by troops of the 7th Armd. Division south of BOMBA at 1400 hours  on the 16/12/41.
     Half-way on their journey they had a most tremendous stroke of luck in finding a miniature ration store containing bully beef and other food stuffs, obviously left by us in our retreat.   This happened when their food was practically exhausted.   
During the whole of the journey they themselves saw no signs of movement and no new tracks, but the 
Arabs informed them that guns and armoured cars were going westward towards BENGHASI.
     While at BENGHASI the men worked in food stores, docks, etc.   They were detailed every day for different jobs.   On the 27th November, ARMSTRONG worked in the docks at unloading a sinking ship.   When they left conditions were chaotic.   They had been shut up for 5 days, no work had been done and Germans and Italians obviously did not know what to do with their prisoners.
     It was due to great courage and unflagging determination that this N.C.O. was able successfully to excape with his two companions in the face of many hardships and handicaps.   They were also observant on their journey and brought back useful information.

During the passage of the minefields near El Alamein on the night of 23/24 October 1942, it was the duty of the 10 Armoured Division Provost Company to go on ahead of the armoured troops for the purpose of marking and lighting the tracks along which the Division was to pass.   The task was one of peculiar difficulty and vital for the success of the operation.   The CMP detachments responsible for two out ot the three tracks allotted to the Division, were commanded by officers.   Owing to shortage of officers the detachment responsible for the third track was commanded by a Sergeant.
Before the first enemy minefield was reached the Sergeant and all the rest of the CMP detachment were killed or wounded except L/Cpl Eeles.   At this critical moment L/Cpl Eeles was left alone with the most important part of the task yet to be completed.   Although this track was one into which the enemy concentrated the greater part of his shell and small arms fire, L/Cpl Eeles, with the assistance of two sappers, placed at his disposal by the CRE, completed the marking and lighting of the tracks along its most dangerous and difficult portion.
The coolness and courage with which this NCO took over and completed his task, his initiative and determination, are deserving of the highest praise and reflect the greatest credit on the Corps of Military Police.

On the night of 20/21 March 1943 Corporal Bradbury was in charge of policing and lighting for the route for ammunition convoys to the forward gun positions.
At LOBSTER CROSSING where Corporal Bradbury was on duty the enemy directed heavy and accurate fire which on several occasions extinguished the track lights.   With complete disregard for his own safety Corporal Bradbury continued to replace the lamps for over an hour during which time the area was continually under shellfire.

Sergeant Domican was Provost Sergeant of 22 Armoured Brigade during the advance from MEDJEZ-EL-BAB to TUNIS.
In the final operation of 6/7 May it was of the highest importance that the centre line of the Brigade be clearly marked so that the remainder of 7 Armoured Division and in particular the Infantry Brigade coming behind, could advance when ordered on the same axis as 22 Armoured Brigade.
This duty devolved on Sergeant Domican who moved with tactical Brigade HQ in a soft skinned vehicle and superintended the marking of the centre line.   When one of his staff had been wounded Sergeant Domican undertook the actual duty of marking the centre line himself, and although frequently under shellfire he carried out his duty with the utmost skill, intelligence and coolness.
He set a high example of courage and devotion to duty and was an inspiration to everyone.

This acting Lance Corporal was posted by me at 1900hrs on 20 April 1943 at map referecne 635285 with instructions to police dumping of ammo by 120 3 ton lorries.   At approximately 22.30 hours I received information that enemy had broken through in the area of  BANANA RIDGE and were approaching the above mentioned area where the 120 vehicles were parked.   I instructed A/ Corproal Quinn to escort the vehicles south of MEDJEZ-EL-BAB. Upon completion of this move at 23.45 hours he returned to an area in Square 6228 and continued to direct other vehicles out ot this area which was then under enemy fire.   From 0200 hours to 1000hours on 21 April 1943 Corporal Quinn was continuously employed on the AROUSSA ROAD keeping same open for tank operational moves etc.   This road was under enemy fire in the vicinity of Main Divisional HQ and Quinn kept all vehicles from entering this area.   During the 15 hours continuous duty this NCO showed great courage and initiative in saving valuable vehicles from being shot up by the enemy.
Between ---?--- and 1600hours on 29 April 1943 A/Corporal Quinn was on duty in the vicinity of PETER'S CORNER, map ref 706325.   At 1500hours he rendered assistance to sappers of 225 Field Company RE map ref 695325 when mortarfire had killed two sappers.   Shortly after this Quinn went to the assistance of tank crew 12 RTR in the vicinity of PETER'S CORNER.   He found Trooper Oates dead and one wounded trooper, whom he had removed to RAP of BW (regimental aid post of the Black Watch).   During this tour of duty all other units considered this  road untenable and Corporal Quinn continued to carry out his duties by patrolling the road on his motorcycle between PETER'S CORNER and the TUNIS ROAD BRIDGE map reference 695625.
I consider that on both occasions mentioned A/Corporal Quinn set a very high example of devotion to duty in this sector of the road by continuing placidly to peform his duty whilst the road was continously under enemy mortar fire.

Sergeant Bullen is an NCO in 69 Brigade Provost Section.   In the battle of El Alamein this NCO was responsible for marking, lighting and control of traffic on the Brigade axis on which supplies, petrol and ammunition were brought forward under cover of darkness to the Brigade.   This he did with such efficiency that it became a point of honour within the section that the marking and lighting of the tracks was maintained 100% complete and by constant patrolling any signs or lights damaged by passing lorries were immediately replaced.   During the attacks on the enemy position he went forward in charge of tracking parties when the line was broken.   He led a tracking party with the pursuing force for a distance of over 140 miles through minefields and over difficult country.   When the Brigade moved from El Alamein to Tobruk in December, Sergeant Bullen marked the tracks for the Brigade over a distance of over 300 miles, again at times through unmarked minefields.   When the Brigade was in Benghazi Sergeant Bullen worked in co-operation with the local CMP in carrying out patrolling of the town and docks.   During the period under review the enthusiasm of this NCO, the example of his work has inspired his men to carry out long, tedious and sometimes dangerous duties with  great efficiency   and regardless of any consideration except giving the best possible service to the Brigade they were supporting.

At Wadi Akarit at about 1700hours on 6 April 1943 he showed great initiative and disregard for personal safety.   He had been sent forward with a detachment from 113 Provost Company under Lt Richards to organise traffic control for the passage of operational traffic through the enemy minefields.   Lance Corporal Bunce was posted near the anti-tank ditch to assist traffic moving in both directions.   Shelling was in progress at the time.   He was instructed to carry out his duties but to take cover if shelling became heavy.   Later very heavy shellfire was concentrated on the spot where Lance Corporal Bunce and another Lance Corporal were posted. In spite of being authorised to take cover Lance Corporal Bunce continued to direct traffic standing upright under intense fire, thereby showing great courage and initiative.   He was struck on the shoulder blade by a piece of rock from a shell burst but remained on duty at his own request.   His steadiness and devotion to duty was an example to those about him and undoubtedly assisted the flow of traffic which might easily have become confused.

During the period under review Sergeant Gibson was NCO i/c 151 Brigade Pro Sect.   He has by his ability been a splendid example and leader of his section.   During the battle of EL ALAMEIN tracks were marked and lit for the bringing forward of supplies, petrol and ammo at night and on the occasion when 151 Brigade advanced into a German position, to establish a bridgehead up the track to pass through, this NCO spent the night in the minefields guiding the advancing tanks through the safe lane.   When this Brigade moved forward from TOBRUCK to BENGHAZI Sergeant Gibson was responsible for marking the track during the latter part of the journey when the convoys were bogged down in the desert due to the heavy rainstorms.   This NCO carried out many recce's to find hard tracks through the waterlogged desert.   He moved about from detachment to detachment guiding them to firm ground and was responsible for several parties being brought to their destination before the supplies they carried were exhausted.   Sergeant Gibson's outstanding abilities, fearlessness and enthusiasm for his work was an inspiration to the men under his command  and on many occasions he has carried out duties that would normally have been the duty of an officer.

On the 15 July 1943 Corporal Patterson in company with Lieutenant J M Mackintosh 51 Highland Div Pro Coy went forward to sign the route of advance of 152 Brigade from CASSIBLE to BRONCOFORTE.   After passing through to BUCCHERI, some Italian soldiers were encountered and taken prisoner, but very shortly afterwards Lieutenant Mackintosh and Corporal Patterson found themselves face to face with a party of 15 more Italians armed with machine guns.   The prisoners taken previously then attempted to escape, and one of these was then shot by Lieutenant Mackintosh.   The rest of the Italians then opened fire on the pair.   Corporal Patterson was immediately severely wounded but continued to fire back.   In a short time Corporal Patterson heard a vehicle approaching from our side of the road and realized that this vehicle would run straight into the enemy's fire.   In spite of his severe chest wound, and risking the chance of  again being shot by the enemy by coming out into the open, Corporal Patterson crawled round the corner and succeeded in preventing the vehicle from coming further, and this saved the occupants.   Some minutes later carriers of 152 Brigade arrived and cleared up the situation.
Throughout this tense and dangerous action Corporal Patterson showed the highest courage and clear-headedness and upheld the best traditions of the Highland Division.

On the night of 6/7 August 1943 Lance Corporal Croft was ordered to take a jeep and wireless set to the far side of a diversion 4 miles north of the centre line on which was passing divisional transport.   He came under heavy mortar and shellfire for four hours but continued to operate his wireless set.   Orders came for him to get back and hold up a Brigade Column. In order to do this he was forced to pass through additional heavy fire also exploding  25 lb shells on burning ammunition lorries.   This order was carried out and all columns prevented from reaching the danger area.
I consider the calm and efficient manner in which this NCO carried out his orders under dangerous and arduous conditions is in keeping with the highest standards of the CMP.

During the period 18 Feb - 31 May 1943 Sergeant Evans has carried out gallant and efficient work at MARETH.   Sergeant Evans was responsible for marking and lighting minefield gaps under heavy shellfire, but at no time did this deter him from completing his task in an efficient manner.   In the same area Sergeant Evans was responsible for the Traffic Control in connection with ammo dumping and it was in great part due to his efficiency that these programmes were successfully carried out night after night in the ENFIDAVILLE area. Sergeant Evans was in charge of the Pro Section attached to 153 Brigade and here again he carried out the marking and lighting of tracks often under heavy shellfire.   Throughout this period Sergeant Evans inspired his section not only by the efficient way he has tackled many difficult and dangerous jobs but also by his complete disregard for his own safety under intense enemy fire.

Sergeant Macleod was in charge of the Provost Section attached to 154 Brigade during the period 18 Feb - 31 May at MARETH.   Sergeant Macleod successfully reconnoitred and marked the cross track from 154 Brigade HQ to the Divisional main axis. Parts of this track were in full view of the enemy and were constantly shelled but on no occasion did Sergeant Macleod allow this to deter him from completing his task.   During the counter attack by the enemy at MARETH from the back area to HQ 154 Brigade he was in full view of the enemy, almost continually shelled.   Sergeant Macleod reconnoitred and marked a diversion to this part of the road and after it had been established he greatly encouraged the men of his section on duty at the diversion by visiting them at all hours of the day and night, especially when the shelling was heaviest.   At ENFIDERVILLE Sergeant Macleod marked out and lit crosstracks in rocky, difficult country which was almost continuously under shellfire.   
Throughout this period Sergeant Macleod carried out his work in an efficient manner and by his own personal courage inspired all the men in his section to carry out their work under difficult and hazardous conditions.

On the 20 April 1944 about 1130 hours LANCIANO was subjected to a heavy air bombardment by FW 190's.   Lance Naik Ranidan Singh was on duty as pointsman at the junction of VIA LUIGI DE CRECCHIO and VIA TRENTO E TRIESTE.   During the perod of the aerial attack the heavy calibre and anit-personnel bombs crashed down near the pointsman, inflicting casualties to soldiers and civilians.   His fellow pointsman in TRAFALGAR SQUARE was killed.   Houses were hit and many trucks brewed up in his immediate vicinity.   Lance Naik Ranidan Singh faced death not only from bombardment but from machine guns which raked VIA LUICI DE CRECCHIO.   During the whole of the attack this policeman stuck to his point and carried out Traffic Control.   He refused to take cover although his billet was but 20 yards away.      Immediately the air attack started a general exodus of military and civilian traffic from LANCIANO began and the general flow from the town focused itself on Lance Naik Ranidan Singh's point.
His courage and devotion to duty undoubtedly saved what may have been a catastrophic traffic block.

Landing with the assault troops on Uncle Red Beach on 9 Sept, Sergeant Brown was in charge of the traffic arrangements from beach to exits.   In spite of fire from mortars, 88mm guns and occasional attacks from low flying aircraft, Sergeant Brown remained constantly on duty for the first 48 hours, directing traffic to the exits.   During the first 12 hours many hundreds of vehicles were landed on the beach and the fact that there was practically at no time any suggestion of a traffic block, was due to this NCO's cool and steadfast behaviour.   Any traffic blocks would have been followed by the gravest consequences.   During the whole of the dismebarkation only two vehicles were destroyed by enemy action.

At NOLA on 4 October 1943 Sergeant Springham was ordered to proceed forward in  a jeep to mark the axis of advance through MARILIANO and MARIGLIANELLA, to the canal crossing to the north.   Soon after setting out his party came under heavy fire and all  road junctions were more or less continuously shelled by heavy guns for a considerable time.   Undaunted and undeterred by this Sergeant Springham continued to mark the route, though several times his jeep was hit by splinters and he and his party were forced to take cover temporarily.   Sergeant Springham was determined to carry on and succeed in his task and by his exceptional devotion to duty and courage this route was completely and successfully marked with the result that a whole Brigade Group was able next day to pass along it without a hitch.   In view of the different formations and large variety of units using the roads of which there were many running in all directions in this particular area, it was absolutely essential that this route be marked to prevent confusion in the advance and except for Sergeant Springham's devotion and excellent work, would not have been achieved.

Between 2000 and 2300 hours on 20 November 1943 it was operationally vital for 101 Pro Coy to collect and dump on the south bank of the river SANGRO large numbers of lamps and signs.   All this equipment had to be distributed over a distance of 4 miles to crossings on the south bank of the river (from MR 402971 to 434012 sheet 148.iv 1/50,000 Italy).   Lance Corporal Clark borrowed a 3 ton lorry from 751 Field Park Company RE and alone peformed this task, under continual shellfire, and in immediate proximity to known enemy minefields.   On the night of 21 November in complete darkness and in heavy rain, Lance Corporal Clark again volunteered to guide all personnel briefed for duty on the five river crossings, under similar adverse conditions, and with no protecting troops in the neighbourhood.   This NCO on both occasions carried out the difficult and dangerous task of driving a 3 ton lorry in an area which was in near proximity to the enemy.   Lance Corporal Clark set a splendid example  of outstanding courage, initiative and devotion to duty.   Since crossing the river SANGRO Lance Corporal Clark has continually been outstanding in his many and varied tasks.

A Company of 760 US Tank Battalion comprising 17 Stuart tanks, one platoon of 105mm guns and Honey tanks of the 7 Brigade Recce Squadron were ordered to concentrate in the hills at a place called MADRAS circus by first light March 12.   It was considered too dangerous to allow the column to proceed via VILLA, and the task of routing the tanks from MICHELE against the traffic circuit to CAIRO and thence to MADRAS circus was assigned to Sgt Birch.   Sgt Birch made a preliminary recce of the route he intended to take by jeep on the evening 11 March, and although shelling was heavy in the CAIRO area pressed on to MADRAS circus and thence back to the tank staging area at MICHELE.   During his journey he was hit by a shell fragment.   However at 0300hrs on the morning of the 12 March he led the tanks from MICHELE, successfully policed the whole column to CAIRO and thence to MADRAS circus.   The noise of the tanks eventually brought down enemy shellfire.   Sgt Birch drove the only soft skinned vehicle of the column, and only by complete disregard for his personal safety was he able to complete his task.   Shortly after, he left company HQ to Command 5 Brigade Pro Det and his unflinching steadfastness by day and night in the hills was an inspiration to all those who worked under him.

In the early hours of 17 March 1944, enemy planes were active over the beachhead.
One bomb was dropped in the area, Map Ref 828218, Italy, sheet no. 158iv, 1:50000, which made a direct hit on a mortar carrier loaded with mortar bombs.   The vehicle caught fire and there was great danger of damage to personnel and vehicles in the vicinity.
Without regard for his own safety, Lance Corporal Donaghy rushed to the carrier and commenced to throw out the mortar bombs, clear of the burning carrier.   These bombs were by then very hot and had begun to explode, but regardless of the fact, Donaghy continued.   He was wounded in the leg but continued till he received a serious wound in the back from the exploding mortar bombs.   Hostile aircraft were still overhead and bombing the area.
There is no doubt that the resourcefulness and quick action of Lance Corporal Donaghy saved many casualties among personnel and vehicles and was responsible for the early controlling of the fire.
Lance Corporal Donaghy's behaviour was of the highest order.  He was lying in his dug-out in the CMP lines, well clear of any possible danger from the carrier when it was hit.

By his leadership and devotion to duty and by his determination to carry out his orders played a valuable part in the establishment of control on and in the vicinity of Sugar Amber Beach from 2 + 20 minutes and for the ensuing 48 hours until ordered to rest and be relieved.   This NCO was landed from an LCI (Landing Craft Infantry) on the Sugar Beach at 2 + 20 minutes with 4 other NCO's with orders to establish as soon as possible after landing, personnel assembly areas and an Information Post at a point some 600 - 650 yards inland.   After being landed approximately 1 mile south of the intended position he made his way in the general direction of the appropriate place, recognition of a building from aerial photographs he had seen gave him the guide he wanted and within a very short time he had carried out his orders and was assisting in every way possible to ensure that the fighting men and vehicles were reaching temporary rendezvous and marrying up with their units.   His task was not made very easy by the fog of war or the enemy's continual mortar and 88 mm fire and sniping.   He set a high example to those under him and surely to those to whom he gave information and help during a difficult critical 48 hours.

The above mentioned NCO was in charge of a Provost Section in support of 167 (London) Infantry Brigade during the attack on MONTE CASINO MASSIF (MR AREA 9508 SHEET 160 JJ, Italy) on the night of 1/2 December 1943.   After completing duties on the battalion start line Sergeant Thake supervised the lighting of all tracks in use.   He then returned to the start line and worked forward again collecting all stragglers, urging  them into the attack and finally assisted in  carrying and helping wounded to ADS's (advanced dressing stations).   Throughout the whole period he was working under enemy shell and mortarfire.

For leadership, initiative and gallant conduct. This NCO was detailed to assist in the evacuation of casualties from the KOHIMA GARRISON on 19 April 1944.   On his own initiative he proceeded to the forward control post where he personally directed the turnaround of ambulances and assisted in the loading of patients.   He remained at his post until the evacuation was complete.   During the evacuation his post was under constant sniping and mortarfire.   One of the ambulances was hit by a mortar bomb, set on fire and the patients all killed or wounded within 10 yards of this NCO who immediately took steps to rescue the patients and clear the road block formed by the burning ambulance.   It was largely due to the high standard of traffic control combined with personal example that this NCO showed, that all the casualties of the KOHIMA GARRISON were successfully evacuated.
Sergeant Tozer in addition has remained in charge of this TCP (Traffic Control Post) for the last month, and during the first two weeks was daily subjected to shell and mortar fire, and accurate sniping.
By his efficiency, initiative and personal example coupled with a complete disregard of his own safety, Sergeant Tozer has ensured that supplies and ammunition reached the garrison and that casualties to personnel and vehicles were kept to a minimum on the stretch of road for which he was responsible, which was in full view of the enemy.   He has maintained throughout an example of devotion to duty and leadership in keeping with the traditions of the Corps of Military Police.

REDHEAD was captured on 29 Jun 42 near FUKA and was sent to a working camp at CICCIANO attached to Camp 82 (LATERINA).
During the afternoon of 11 Sep 43 the whole of the P/W in this working camp went into the nearby mountains, where REDHEAD remained until he was recaptured by Fascists.   Taken to FORTRESSA DI BASSO, he found six other P/W already there, and , under cover of loud singing they removed the mortar of the brick wall of their cell.   When this was completed five days later, they got out of the cell and negotiated the outer wall by climbing on to the roof of an adjoining building and letting themselves down the other side by means of a rope made from a blanket.   With three others, REDHEAD then went into the mountains and joined a rebel band at CAMERINO.   On 15 Mar 44 REDHEAD was again arrested and taken to MACERATA Civil Goal, but six weeks captivity was terminated when the 13 P/W overcame their five guards during an air raid alarm.
Remaining hidden in the vicinity of FERMO, REDHEAD was included in an evacuation scheme organised  by 'A' Force, and reached TERMOLI on 25 May 44.

ESCAPES FROM CAMP 82 (LATERINA), ITALY
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AWARDS

(1) After the Armistice with Italy had been signed the Senior British Officer of the camp advised P/W to remain there, but did not actively prevent their escaping.   There was a mass breakout by some French Foreign Legion troops, who were fired on by Italian guards, and a certain number of British P/W escaped during the confusion.   The majority, however, remained in camp and were captured by the Germans when they took over.
A number of sub-working camps were attached to Camp 82 and most of the P/W in them seem to have had little difficulty in getting away after the Armistice.

During the night of 11/12 May 1944 the above named NCO went forward with the infantry to assist with traffic control at mr 868184 Italy, in the assault crossing of the RIVER GARI (also known as RAPIDO).   On the night of 12/13 May 1944 he was the only CMP on duty near the river, the remaining NCO's being casualties.   He remained on duty at AMAZON BRIDGE (class 30 bridge south of Cassino) with only 5 hours break until relieved at 1200 hours 15 May 1944, a period of approximately 4 days.   Upon arrival of reliefs he was ordered to a point further back but asked that he may be permitted to remain at the river as he was fully conversant with the duties required, regardless that it was still under heavy shellfire.   He showed exceptional bravery in the face of almost continuous enemy fire, giving confidence and setting an outstanding example.

When the crossing failed, heavy shelling and mortaring occurred and this NCO showed  great courage and bravery not only in keeping his own section of men together but also all other personnel in the vicinity.   One Traffic Control Post under his control failed to report in after all other TP's had left the area and the river crossing and he went forward through heavy mortar fire to locate them.   During the morning of 12 May he also volunteered to go forward to attempt to recover vehicles which had been sent forward to raft the river and had been held up with shell and mortar fire.   Although he was unable to recover the vehicles he cleared the area of troops, searching very diligently for wounded in spite of being in view of the enemy.   During the ensuing days of 13,14 and 15 May this NCO was forward on the bridges the whole time, and by his courage and personal disregard for safety kept his section together when under mortar and shellfire.

On the 13th May 1944, in Burma, shots were heard coming from the direction of a Line of Communication signal lines. Shortly after, a message was received to the effect that a man had run amok with a rifle and ammunition and was firing at everybody and everything.   Sergeant-Major Noble went over to the signal lines armed with a Tommy gun, meeting an officer on the way who showed him the location of the man who had run amok, who it appeared had got into a Quartermaster's store, as shots were coming from the store rather rapidly.   After about half an hour of manoeuvre and during which time firing was continuous, Sergeant-Major Noble and a number of others closely surrounded the store, where about 1700 rounds of ammunition and a dozen or so rifles were stored.   Sergeant-Major Noble, who was covering the only doorway waited for a chance to fire at the man inside in order to disable him;  the chance arrived, and on attempting to fire, he found that his Tommy gun had become jammed.   Showing  great presence of mind and total disregard for personal danger, Sergeant-Major Noble rushed into the store, disarmed the man and after a short struggle held him securely to the floor.   Sergeant-Major Noble said afterwards that when he got inside the store he found it to be darker than outside, and that he was unable to see, but after stumbling about, suddenly felt somebody on the floor, so he jumped on him.

After a struggle during which the girl pulled Sergeant Ridsdale under the water, Sergeant Ridsdale managed to get her to the bank where with help they were pulled ashore.   The river at the particular point is very treacherous owning to swift flowing tides and currents and, owing to it being high tide at the time, the rescue was carried out under extreme difficulties.

As Sgt MUGGERIDGE continued to advance upon the soldier, the soldier ran into the street and down a side alley.

Sgt MUGGERIDGE being unarmed, picked up a stone and slowly mounted the steps, the while calling to the soldier to come down.   When having advanced to within some 4 or 5 feet of the armed soldier, a shout raised below momentarily distracted the soldier's attention.

The action of Sgt MUGGERIDGE in arresting an armed felon, having been fired upon at point-blank range, and knowing him to be dangerous and likely to resist at all costs, the fact that he achieved this himself unarmed, constitutes an act of extreme courage and displays the highest devotion to duty.

Throughout the months of January and February 1944, this NCO peformed excellent service, occasionally under shellfire, in ensuring that the supplies by mule were hastened up the mountain during the hours of darkness, which frequently necessitated him making the long and difficult journey between the two dumps two and three times a night.

Coloured mule drivers were killed and wounded and a slight panic broke out with the mules becoming frightened.   This NCO collected the wounded, got them into ambulances, restored order and discipline among the mule drivers and had the roadway cleared of dead mules, despite the fact that shells were still falling near the dump.   Although not having driven an ambulance previously, this NCO drove an ambulance of wounded to 185 ADS(advanced dressing station) where his action was very favourably commented upon by the OC and Medical Officer.   On many other occasions while 'PATELY BRIDGE' across the river Garigliano was under shellfire this NCO by his own example of coolness and appreciation of the situation, displayed courage without regard for his personal safety and was an inspiration to junior NCO's.

Lance Corporal Boulton during the Battle for Cassino from early February to end of March 44 was assigned the task of maintaining Pro communications and patrolling the divisional axis and forward tracks into the hills, a vital telephone communication between VILLA TP and CAIRO TP operated so as to allow vehicles to proceed safely through the circuit only when enemy shelling had temporarily slackened.  Lance Corporal Boulton repaired cuts in the line and kept this communication in working order only by complete disregard for his personal safety.   His unflinching steadfastness during day and night patrolling enabled him to get word back to the Recovery and so clear knocked out vehicles and to request RE assistance to fill in shell holes in quick time.   On 12th March he assisted in policing a column of tanks from MICHELE to MADRAS circus and although heavy shellfire came down on the route he reached his destination and succeessfully completed a dangerous Provost Operation. He faced death on numerous occasions pressing home his jeep patrol on the CAIRO circuit and forward tracks, knowing full well that the enemy shelling was accurately arranged on his portion of the Div axis.

Preparatory to the attack by the Division at ESCOVILLE on the 18 July 1944 four gaps had been cleared in our own minefields through which the entire Division were to pass.   To facilitate the passage of  personnel and vehices a CMP pointsman was placed on duty at each gap.   From the time the attack started at 0745 hours until late that evening the four gaps were subjected to incessant and accurate mortar and shellfire.   During the course of the morning the three other Provost Lance Corporals who were on duty became casualties from this fire.   Lance Corporal Thomas however, remaind on duty throughout the day amidst a continual hail of missiles.   Never once did he falter in the discharge of his duties, and throughout the period he showed the greatest keenness and interest in his job and was at all times able to convey information of great importance as to which units had passed through the gaps.   This NCO's gallantry and complete disregard for his personal safety, even after all his comrades had been wounded was a source of great inspiration to all who saw him.   The efficient way in which he controlled the traffic and in which he sent back information was of the greatest assistance to the Division; and the fact that the whole Division passed through the gaps without a single traffic jam occurring, must be largely attributed to this NCO's coolness and personal discipline under fire.   Lance Corporal Thomas's conduct throughout the day was worthy of the highest praise and was in accordance with the finest traditions of the Corps of Military Police.

On 28 June 1944 during the action in which 15 (s) Division was engaged in securing the crossing over the RIVER ODON No6198473 Sergeant Gadsden, with his section of 15 (S) Division Provost Company, was on traffic duty in CHEUX and the roads leading south.   During the evening of that date when the enemy threatened a breakthrough in this sector, Sergeant Gadsden held his section together and personally directed traffic over a period of several hours, although subjected to heavy fire from enemy snipers and shelling.
During the period 15 - 18 July 1944, when 15 (S) Inf Div was engaged south of the RIVER ODON, Sergeant Gadsden and his section of 15 (S) Div Pro Coy was again on duty controlling traffic over the river on 4 bridges.   During this period the river crossings were subjected to considerable shelling and mortar fire.   In spite of numerous casualties amongst personnel of his company Sergeant Gadsden visited all his men on all the bridges encouraging them in their work and actively assisting in the control of traffic.   By his example he ensured  the smooth flow of traffic at all times over the river and inspired his men in the execution of their duties.

Sgt Meaking worked the whole day without respite and by his extraordinary display of discipline, tact and patience, contributed in no small way to the successful handling of a situation which at times assumed very ugly proportions.   During the seven days the mutineers remained in the FPC, this NCO, by his appreciation of the situation and tactful handling of the Greeks, succeeded in not only ensuring a complete freedom from incident between the various factions in th camp, but also disciplined them to the extent of organising them into their original units, providing their own working and fatigue parties and preparing their compounds daily for inspection by the Camp Commander.   Having regard to the attitude of the mutineers on arrival at the camp after surrendering the work of this Sergeant deserves the highest praise.   He also provided valuable assistance in the identification and segregation of the leader of the mutiny Pte ANDRIOTES.

Sergeant Fewings has been i/c of the Pro Section attached to 146 Infantry Brigade for 18 months.   In England, he did sterling work in keeping up interest and efficiency of his section.   Since arrival in France, he had continually been out on the roads, signing routes, carrying out route recces and visiting point.
After the capture of FONTENAY-LE-PESNEL, he led his section forward to mark routes for ambulances and other priority vehicles under aimed  MMG and mortar fire, and it was largely due to his enterprise that these vehicles got through.
As the main weight of the enemy artillery has been on the roads he has continually  had to work under shellfire.   He has always been cheerful and tireless in his work and has been an inspiration to his section, the work of whom has been outstanding.

On the 14 July 1944 Lance Corporal Nicholson was directing the traffic at the Bailey Bridge at CASTIGLIONE E FIORENTINO.   Very accurate shellfire was opened on the bridge but Lance Corporal Nicholson continued to direct traffic, ignoring the danger.
The drivers of a number of lorries approaching the bridge and seeing the bursts, took cover.   This Lance Corporal appreciated that these lorries were on an exposed stretch of the road and that a serious block in full view of the enemy would ensure their destruction.   With great calmness Lance Corporal Nicholson went down the road and ordered each driver to return to his vehicle and proceed on his way.   In this way he got the whole column moving again.
By his example and total disregard for danger, he kept the traffic flowing and  undoubtedly prevented a situation which might have resulted in serious loss of life and transport.   The bridge remained under fire almost continuously throughout the tour of his duty.

Nov 17 1943 - May 14 1944   Throughout the divisonal campaign in the ARAKAN, this NCO has worked with untiring vigour, personally escorting convoys by day and by night over the NGAKYEDAUK PASS, especially during the later months of 1943, when the pass was in its initial and most dangerous stage.
When the unit lines in the Div HQ area at LAUNG CHAUNG were attacked by the enemy on 6 February 1944, Corporal Ellis at considerable personal  risk, carried a wounded signaller from the area, and drove him away to hospital in the Admin Box.   Later at 1730 hours the same day he returned with the OC unit in a jeep to assist in warning the last tanks to cover the withdrawal of the medium guns.   During the period the jeep was subjected to enemy machine gun fire and the three occupants could not break cover from behind it.   To get to safety Corporal Ellis started the jeep with his hand; jumped into the seat, and drove it to safety whilst the others hung on , on the sheltered side.   On the following day 7 February when communications by phone were out in the NGAKYEDAUK PASS, he proceeded together with the OC unit and Lance Corporal Bailey, in a carrier, to a point half way down the pass, which was in a few hours, cut by the enemy.   Throughout the three weeks seige which followed, this NCO worked continuously without relief, and was an outstanding example to the rest of his unit.

PLAU, ARAKAN.   After the evacuation of the Div HQ Area on 6 February at 17.30hrs this NCO accompanied the OC unit back to the unit lines to assist in the withdrawal of the medium guns.   On that occasion he proceeded to the unit MT area to attempt to save a vehicle, although the area was occupied by the enemy;  and he only returned when the fire was heavy.   On 7 February he proceeded to the centre of the GNAKYEDAUK PASS, with the OC unit and Corporal Ellis, in three carriers.   The carriers returned and Lance Corporal Bailey was instructed to remain behind and bring back a party of BOR's (British other ranks) on foot, as the carriers were full.   After the departure of the carriers the road was cut by enemy fire between him and his destination.   Other personnel turned back but Lance Corporal Bailey took his party forward at considerable risk, made a detour through the jungle and returned to his unit several hours later in the admin box, although he had every excuse under the circumstance for returning to a safer place.
On 19 March when the enemy again attacked the box, and when they held a position on a high feature at the entrance to the east end of the box, this BOR under great personal risk rode his Motor Cycle out into the open paddy fields in view of the enemy and underfire, to inform the commander of 3 tanks to return to the box.

On the night of 2 October 1944 Lance Corporal Murphy was on duty on the southern end of the NIJMEGEN pontoon bridge.   His task was to direct traffic and to ensure that vehicles of 69 Brigade Group who were crossing the bridge from north to south were directed to their concentration area.   Throughout the night the bridge and bridge approach were shelled and bombed, and many of the nearby houses set on fire.
He maintained a close watch in his area for craters and falling masonry which might block the road, and cleared away the rubble if necessary.   The guiding lamps had been rendered useless and as his voice was drowned by other noises, he had to jump on vehicle after vehicle to direct the driver.   In the general excitement of the situation many vehicles went in the wrong direction.   These he ran after and corrected. 
On one occasion blast from a bomb which burst neaby lifted him off his feet and threw him against a wall of a burning house several yards away.   Although severely bruised, cut and badly shaken he immediately returned to his task, with complete disregard for his personal safety,  and remained on duty until he was relieved three hours later when the last vehicle had passed.
Due to his energy and untiring devotion to duty, chaos, which would have led to the loss of vehicles and lives, was averted and the column was able to reach its destination without casualties.

Citation for BEM:  During the early part of May, prior to the launching of the Cassino offensive 105 Provost Company was responsible for bringing the armour to the forward Army boundary.   This was done on tracks by night.   Sjt Burg was responsible for the greater part of this work, and to the outstanding manner in which he carried out his duties of track lighting and escorting over rough country without regard to personal fatigue and discomfort over long periods, the smooth and efficient way in which the armour was fed forward could largely be attributed.   On 4 Aug 44, when British troops entered Florence, Sjt Burge took his section into the city.   He was the senior NCO of a police detachment which went in in the early hours of occupation.   During the first ten days, when the city was not completely in Allied hands, Sjt Burge showed great coolness and efficiency during a most trying period.   The area was under shell and mortar fire and there were many cases of civilian disturbances and sniping.   The excellent example set to his men, his efficiency and devotion to duty, enabled his detachment to do invaluable work in establishing and maintaining order, keeping up civilian morale, controlling and preventing civilian and refugee movements.   At this time our line in the city was lightly held at the river;  had any of these factors assumed undue proportions, military operations in and around the city might have been severley hampered.   Sjt Burge has had charge of a section of this Company throughout the Desert, Sicilian and Italian campaigns.   His example to his men, and devotion to duty, have at all times been outstanding.

On 16 September 1944 during the operation of crossing the ESCAUT CANAL Sergeant Cox and his section were detailed to control traffic on the enemy side of the two newly built bridges.   The river banks from which it was necessary to control traffic were under observed fire.   Despite fire from the enemy Sergeant Cox remained on the bridge sites and by his coolness, fine example and constant supervision of his section, ensured the smooth flow of traffic.
On 18 October 1944 he again displayed courage and devotion to duty in the liberation of VENRAIJ
In his handling of refugees, thus keeping the roads clear for urgent operational traffic.   During this period he was under heavy shellfire and mortar fire but showing complete disregard for his own safety encouraged his section to carry out their work.

One of his accomplices was found in a bedroom dressed in military uniform and another, dressed in civilian clothes hiding in a sack.   Further enquiries led to the arrest of two more deserters, one of whom was an American, in the possession of a stolen Jeep, but only after a struggle in the course of which, the latter was disarmed of a Browning Automatic pistol.   In their possession was a considerable sum of money and quantities of jewellery were found in the houses of civilians who had been harbouring all five men.   These civilians have since been arrested.   From evidence to hand it became evident that these men were responsible for several armed robberies in the environs of AVELLINO, which had begun some ten months previously.   Many of the victims of these robberies have now been traced by CSM PROCTER and their property identified.   Once these men had effected a hold-up on one road they would immediately switch to another part of the country.   On occasion they would represent themselves as Military Police.   Operating in the dark, identification by their victims was made extremely difficult.

Citation:  This NCO has been in charge of a sub section of 8 Indian Div. Pro. Coy since May 1944.   During this period he has shown a high standard of leadership and devotion to duty.   On the R. GARI from May 11th to May 15th, Cpl Clements' men were on duty at track junctions or on bridges which the enemy regularly shelled.   He was always visiting them and encouraging them with his cheerfulness and cool disregard of danger.   Later, during the pursuit near PERUGIA, Cpl Clements had to take charge of the whole section owing to the illness of his section Sjt.   He again showed great fortitude and kept his men in good heart whilst manning points of considerable danger on the road to RIPA.   Cpl Clements cheerfulness and read assumption of responsibility have been a very great asset to the Company, and a fine example to the men serving under him.

After crossing a field on to the main road, he went to a 15cwt truck which was waiting and forced the driver out of the cab at the point of his pistol.   The other NCO ran towards the left hand door of the truck, but when a few feet away, he saw the prisoner pointing his revolver at him, and threw himself to the ground just as the shot was fired.   Meantime, Lance-Corporal Gent, who had been the driver of the jeep and was a few yards behind in the pursuit, saw all this taking place, including, as it appeared to him, the shooting of the NCO.  He ran to the right hand side of the cab, and after a struggle, succeded in knocking the revolver from the man's hand and with the help of the other NCO overpowered him and took him into custody.

Escape and evasion Italy
SAWYER was captured near TOBRUK on 14 Sep 42 together with other survivors of a small raiding force.   At the time of the Italian Armistice he was at MONTURANO (Camp 70) and after leaving without difficulty on 15 Sep 43 he went to SAN VITTORIA.   A month later he was caught by Fascists as he was returning from an unsuccessful attempt to reach Allied hands by sea.   On 15 Dec 43, SAWYER and an American cut the wire over his window and escaped from MACERATA (Camp 53).
Reaching TOLENTINO, SAWYER remained in that area until he accompanied a partisan band to MONASTERO.   Although he was recaptured by Fascists, he managed to slip away while awaiting transport and went to SAN GINESIO.   Early in May 44 he traveled North in the hope of reaching YUGOSLAVIA but gave up the attempt at MONTE MARCIANO.   After being guided over the GRAN SASSO, SAWYER and two officers were betrayed to the enemy.   On this occasion SAWYER was sent to LATERINA and on 17 Jun 44 he escaped during the evacuation of the camp.
SAWYER hid near TRAMUSCANO until he met British forces on 24 Aug 444.

Soon it became apparent that considerable sums were being circulated amongst Allied personnel and civilians and that the situation was becoming extremely serious.   WOII TUBBY L. was assigned to the task of locating the source of these spurious notes, which was thought to be in ROME, and to arrest the offenders.   From the day he received his orders until March 1945, when he had arrested 15 civilians, now known to be cunning and determined criminals, this Warrant Officer visited all military and civil organisations where such money might be passed and all were regimented to tender information spontaneously.   He sifted, compared and examined hundreds of spurious notes; checked and re-checked the stories of absentees and deserters until finally, through his own untiring efforts he single handed tracked down and seized the printing presses on which the notes were made, together with all the paraphernalia for counterfeiting.   He recovered 2,500,000 Lira in counterfeit Allied Military Currency which must have, otherwise seriously threatened the currency now in use.   Finally he presented such a weight of evidence that the first two counterfeiters to be tried by an Allied court chose to plead guilty.   In the midst of these investigations, he also successfully solved the reported murder of an allied soldier in FROSINONE in which no corpse could be found at the outset.   He located, retrieved, and identified the body as that of a Canadian soldier, for the murder of whom he arrested and brought to trial four Italian civilians.    Lt Col G White DPM Rome Area.

Throughout this period this NCO frequently displayed great initiative, energy and unlimited patience and tact in organising rations for the kitchens, assisting the aged and infirm to obtain medical treatment, arranging accommodation; and in general performing, in a highly meritorious and most praiseworthy manner, duties that were superior to those required of a junior NCO.  He gave his time and energy unstintingly to the performance of these duties, the greater part of which  were carried out voluntarily after he had completed tasks for which he had been detailed.   His unselfish devotion to duty in extremelty trying circumstances was quite beyond praise.. He undoubtedly contributed in a large measure to the successful feeding and housing of  the many refugees who locked into the area for which his Section was responsible and his work was frequently subject of favourable comments from officers of other branches and from civilian officials.   Thus, he did much to enhance the prestige of his Corps in particular and the service as a whole.

Citation for BEM.  The above named NCO has, over a long period, continually distinguished himself by his high sense of duty, perseverance, and hard work, showing a great degree of bravery under difficult and unusual circumstances.   His cheerful character, together with the above remarks, have inspired other members of this section, and has led to the arrest of many dangerous criminals, both Service personnel and civilians.   In my opinion, he merits and award of the BEM.   One example of his work in the Special Investigation Branch is as follows:  Many offences had been committed by a gang of armed deserter-thieves in this Area during the later months of 1944 and it became know that certain deserters, well know to this Section, were responsible.   Extensive enquiries were made and certain plans adopted.   On 28 Nov 44, two members of this gang were arrested.   They were armed with Italian pistols.   The known ringleader and other members of his gang were still at large.   On 5 Dec 44., information was received that these men were in a public square in Bari.   Sgt. Hearn and two other SIB men, accompanied by a CMP Patrol went to this square.   The CMP Patrol could not be actively employed in the search for the deserters because of their conspicuous dress and were told to watch the movements of the SIB men.   Sgt Hearn and the other two SIB men then went into the crowded square and commenced to look for the deserters.   It was well known that they would be armed and they would resist arrest.   As he neared four men (3 British deserters and an Italian criminal) they opened fire with automatic pistols and ran quickly away, firing at the Sgt and other SIB men as they did so, but without hitting them.   Sgt Hearn chased two of the men towards the CMP patrol.   On seeing the patrol one of the two men (the ringleader) opened fire on them.   A CMP Cpl returned the fire and shot the deserter, who was then arrested.   Sgt Hearn continued after the other man and eventually arrested him.   The remaining two deserters escaped in the large crowd that gathered, but good work by Sgt Hearn led to their arrest the following day.   Subsequent on this incident, Sgt Hearn brought about the arrest of no less than 24 Italians who were charged with being concerned with the deserters in larceny and receiving stolen property.   Property to the value of over 4,000 (W D vehicles etc) was recovered against the ringleader alone.   It is considered that the arrest of this gang had a great deterrent effect on other less dangerous deserters who might then have been in this Area and the good work of Sgt. Hearn enabled this Section to concentrate on other pressing work.

SGT ORDWAY was engaged on special duty with a selected Police squad to combat this grave threat to law and order.

In addition he has been largely responsible for the complete re-organisation of the Provost Coy during the period.   His example has at all times been a source of inspiration to those under him.

Escape and evasion Italy
RAYNER was taken prisoner in N.Africa on 27 May 42.   At the time of the Italian Armistice he was a prisoner at MONTURANO (Camp 70).   Contrary to the orders of the S.B.O. he left this camp on 12 Sep. 43, forcing his way past the English and Italian sentries.
Travelling to the ASCOLI PICENO area RAYNER found shelter with Italian civilians.   From the beginning of March 44 until June 44 RAYNER did excellent work in distributing to other P/W supplies dropped by parachute and in collecting P/W into parties for crossing the lines.   In addition, he assisted in partisan activities for 5 months, being wounded during a rain on CASTIGANO on 12 Jun.44.   Six days later he entered ASCOLI PICENO with the partisans and assumed command until the arrival of Allied forces.   RAYNER continued to work for AMGOT for another month before he went to the Repatriation Centre.

Sergeant Fitch was carrying out security duties on board S.S.

Many Germans lost their lives and severe fires broke out.   Without a thought for his own safety, Sergeant Fitch immediately went ashore, carried out a reconnaissance of the neighbour hood where there was considerable confusion and established a road-block to prevent traffic impeding rescue and fire services, and also arranged traffic diversions to keep unessential traffic from the scene of the explosion.   After having handed over to the German Police, he visited the scene of the fire and discovered that it was spreading rapidly and also that a large number of depth charges were likely to explode at any moment.   He returned to S.S. ""Patria"" and gare this information to the ship's Executive Officer, who ordered him to evacuate all Allied and German personnel from the ship.

He has, since June 1944, when the Division landed in FRANCE, worked tirelessly and unstintingly and deserves the highest praise for his magnificent example of leadership and efficiency.   In the difficult days leading to the breakthrough at CAEN when the Provost Company were called upon to work 24 hours a day bringing up tanks and transport over muddy tracks,   RSM Booth was always out amongst his men, checking routes, helping patrols and keeping transport moving over bad country.   Even in the most trying circumstances he has always set the highest possible standard of smartness and discipline which has inspired his men beyond measure.   In the fast moving days up to the SEINE and the chase through FRANCE and BELGIUM and then into HOLLAND he was always about with the men giving encouragement and advice and getting the Division to its destination.

He has invariably carried out all his duties in an exemplary manner.   Frequently he has been asked to perform the most arduous tasks and has carried them out to perfection at all times, regardless of any danger to himself.   During the RHINE crossing his main task was to establish a TCP at a cross-roads on the enemy side of the river.   The TCP was established by 0700hrs on D Day and remained in operation for two days.   During this period the cross-roads was under almost continuous and accurate enemy mortar and shellfire.   Sgt Milne remained at this cross-roads during the whole period, ignoring danger to himself and ensuring that the cross-roads was kept clear of traffic the whole time.   The latter meant his being above ground most ot the time and fully exposed to every danger.   On innumerable occasions this NCO has carried out equally arduous tasks always with the same courage and determination and always to perfection.   His conduct in and out of battle is always of the highest order and an excellent example to his men.

Sergeant Evans has served with 11 Armoured Division throughout the whole campaign in North West Europe and has at all times performed his duties in an exemplary manner with complete disregard for his own safety.   His duty is to sign the divisional centre line and to do this he always travelled in a jeep close behind the leading tanks and has carried out his duties under heavy shell and small arms fire.   In particular during battles between the RIVER MAAS and RIVER RHINE in February/March 1945 when all main roads in the forward area were subjected to heavy enemy shellfire he carried out his duties with remarkable courage.   During the advance from the RIVER RHINE to LUBECK the Division moved on very small roads with many complicated turnings where it was very easy for drivers to take the wrong turning.   By completely ignoring his own safety and being right forward he was able to sign the centre line and thus materially assist the maintenance of the advance.   At all times this NCO's cheerfulness and devotion to duty together with his complete disregard for his own safety have been a complete inspiration to his section.

Sergeant Simpson was commanding the section of Provost attached to 185 Infantry Brigade during the battles for  KERVENHEIM and WINNEKENDONK in March 1945 and later during the advance over the RHINE to LINGEN, this NCO was responsible for signing and lighting the brigade routes and for Traffic Control.   He constantly displayed courage and leadership of the highest order in carrying out these tasks, often under heavy enemy fire and during the confused fighting of the advance with complete disregard for his personal safety he advanced with the forward troops marking gaps through minefields and reconnoitring diversions for AFV's.   His untiring efforts greatly assisted the advance of the Brigade.   Throughout the campaign Sergeant Simpson by his courage and determined leadership has been an example not only to his section but the whole Divisional Provost Company.

On the 10 February 1945 in the outskirts of CLEVE Lance Corporal Reid was placed in charge of other NCO's of the CMP and was ordered to establish a traffic control post on the main NIJMEGEN -CLEVE ROAD by which formations of 30 Corps were to advance during OPERATION VERITABLE.   By force of circumstances Lance Corporal Reid had set up his TC post beside the road in an area which was already flooded to a depth of several inches.   No sooner was the post established than it and traffic passing came under accurate shellfire.   During the ensuing days the shelling and flooding became progressively worse, until conditions became so bad, that after 7 days traffic was stopped and Lance Corporal Reid, by now suffering from lack of sleep and exposure, was ordered to close his post.
Throughout this period of great hardship and danger Lance Corporal Reid showed a complete disregard for himself and by his determination and devotion to duty  was largely responsible for the continuous flow of traffic to the forward troops.

Sergeant Watts has served continuously with 53 Div Pro Coy during the European campaign and has proved himself an outstanding section leader.   At WEEZE this sergeant successfully convoyed bridging vehicles through to the bridging site.   When the main route was blocked with traffic held up by craters Sergeant Watts reconnoitred a diversion despite the risk of mines which were known to be in the area.   Sergeant Watts' section was put in charge of RETHAM during the early stages.   Despite shelling and bombing he organised traffic both in the town and at the bridge site, and by his untiring devotion to duty and organising ability, was an inspiration not only to his section but all ranks in the area.   During the 3 months under review Sergeant Watts' section has been continuously in the line experiencing both heavy shelling, mortaring and bombing.   His handling of every situation has been exellent and his responsibilities far above those of  one of his rank.

The shooting was carried out by three absentees in a stolen vehicle.   These men also kidnapped a Military Policeman who had been on duty at the same time.   The Company was turned out to apprehend these men.   RSM GORDON and L/Cpl GREGSON were first to leave in pursuit.   They were informed that the vehicle had gone NORTH and learned that the MP had thrown himself from the stolen vehicle while the absentees were threatening to murder him.   At approximately 5 miles along Route 6, RSM GORDON noticed and overturned vehicle on the left of the road.   He stopped, and both he and LCpl GREGSON alighted to investigate.   As they did so, they were fired upon from the right hand side of the road.   Appreciating that these fugitives might be on both sides of the road the WO and NCO regained their vehicle and reversed some 15 yards to a better position.   From here, they returned fire of the absentees in an effort to pin them down and so prevent them leaving the area before further police arrived, and also to prevent the armed men reaching their vehicle which might have contained more ammunition.   When his own ammunition was expended, RSM GORDON proceeded to seek reinforcements, ordered LCpl GREGSON to maintain the position.   Both the WO and NCO
were fully aware that the three absentees were desperate men and that they had the advantage of cover.   In the moonlight, any movement on the road could plainly be seen, and it was not known what type of arms the absentees were using.   By their prompt action, disregard of personal risk and determination,they succeeded in holding one absentee in his position where he was later arrested, and was instrumental in confining the area of movement of the other two who were subsequenly apprehended.

Citation for MBE: OTTAVIANO is a small Italian village located on the slopes of VESUVIUS, some twenty miles from the city of NAPLES.   In January 1944 a site was selected in this village for the Depot & Training Establishment, CMP, which was being transferred from NORTH AFRICA to ITALY to meet an ever increasing commitment to train soldiers for transfer to the Corps of Military Police.   The site selected was an old castle which was in a very dilapitated condition and which was most unsuitable for use as a Training Establishment.   However, owing to the many calls upon accommodation facilities in the area, it was the best obtainable at the time and action had to be taken to convert it to meet the requirements of the CMP Depot.   The problems confronting the Administrative Staff of the Depot were to convert this Castle into a Training Establishment fitted for all aspects of basic army re-training and for specialised training in Police duties.   New installations such as cookhouses, dining rooms, preparation rooms, store houses, to mention only a few had to be built at a time when skilled military labour and supplies from military sources were required for more urgent operational tasks.  This WO displayed capabilities of an outstanding nature in improvising materials and organising local Italian labour to carry out the tasks with which he was confronted, and without the completion of which this Establishment, as a training organisation, could not function.   In addition, he organised catering facilities for upwards of 1300 military personnel, often with the minimum assistance in trained catering personnel.   He has furthermore, overcome the complexities of clothing and equipping a diversity of many races of our ALLIES who have been trained in Police duties at this establishment.   In conclusion his unbounded enthusiasm and energy has been one of the main conrerstones on which this Depot has effectively carried out ist role and his contribution in its control is beyond the highest praise.

Act of Gallantry
The GOC desires to place on record the act of gallantry described below, performed by the following WO and NCO:-
2692809 RSM Gordon T CMP
4545080 LCpl Gregson G E CMP
On the night of 30 Oct 44, and NCO of the Corps of Military Police was shot in the stomach when on duty on Route 6.   The shooting was carried out by three absentees in a stolen vehicle.   These men also kidnapped a Military Policeman who had been on duty at the same time.   The Company was turned out to apprehend these men.   RSM GORDON and LCpl GREGSON were first to leave in pursuit.   They were informed that the vehicle had gone NORTH and learned that the MP had thrown himself from the stolen vehicle while the absentees were threatening to murder him.   At approximately 5 miles along Route 6, RSM GORDON noticed and overturned vehicle on the left of the road.   He stopped, and both he and LCpl GREGSON alighted to investigate.   As they did so, they were fired upon from the right hand side of the road.   Appreciating that these fugitives might be on both sides of the road the WO and NCO regained their vehicle and reversed some 15 yards to a better position.   From here, they returned fire of the absentees in an effort to pin them down and so prevent them leaving the area before further police arrived, and also to prevent the armed men reaching their vehicle which might have contained more ammunition.   When his own ammunition was expended, RSM GORDON proceeded to seek reinforcements, ordered LCpl GREGSON to maintain the position.   Both the WO and NCO
were fully aware that the three absentees were desperate men and that they had the advantage of cover.   In the moonlight, any movement on the road could plainly be seen, and it was not known what type of arms the absentees were using.   By their prompt action, disregard of personal risk and determination,they succeeded in holding one absentee in his position where he was later arrested, and was instrumental in confining the area of movement of the other two who were subsequenly apprehended.

   This NCO landed in Algiers on 13/11/1942 and the Section in which he was serving was sent to Bone immediately.   He carried on his duties at all times with great efficiency and unconcern for the heavy Air Raids to which the town was subjected at the time.
     During one particularly heavy raid a part of the town was set on fire by incendiary bombs and the local Fire Brigade were turned out to deal with them.   Before the fire fighting equipment was properly connected, HE bombs were dropped and the native firemen left their equipment and tool cover.   L/Cpl Hearn who was on duty at the time removed incendiaries from nearby buildings, coupled up the hoses, and was responsible for the fires being quickly extinguished.
     During the whole time his section was on duty at Bone, this NCO's bearing whilst carrying out Police work under heavy stress was worthy of the highest praise.

MBE Citation:  During the past three years, as RSM of the 506 Provost Coy, Sjt-Major Green has rendered outstanding service to the Eight Army and Corps of Military Police while serving in the Western Desert, Cyrenaica, and throughout the entire Sicilian and Italian campaigns.   Of especial note is his gallant and successful work for four months on the tracks south of El Alamein, and later his valuable work, much of which was beyond the normal call of duty, in connection with the civil population in Sicily during the early occupation of the island.   Throughout the whole period RSM Green has given of his very best and devoted himself whole-heartedly to the maintenance of discipline and prevention of crime in the Army, and, in particular, he has been largely responsible for efficiency, bearing and turnout of the Military Police under command.   His personal example and conduct at all times have been of the highest order.   The 506 Provost Company has played a big part in the smooth working of the Eight Army's three thousand miles advance from Egypt and in the maintenance of the forward troops druring this long period.   The success that has attended the police arrangements, the traffic control, and route signing of this company has, in a very large measure, been due to the guidance and splendid example of RSM Green..Lieut Col J R Archer Burton, OBE, DPM Eight Army.

Citation for BEM:   Throughout the period 1 Apr 45 to 2 May 45 havildar BHANBIR THAPA has displayed outstanding leadership and initiative on all occasions.   Whenever road movement was restricted to passing over a single bridge or through a single bottle neck, he has by his own exeptional efforts made possible the steady flow of traffic without road blocks, which was so vital during the rapid advance from the R Senio to the R Adige.   During the envelopment and eventual capture of FERRARA his section was controlling PHUL BRIGES connecting Route 18 with the only route by-passing the city.   Although designed for use only by the Division and sited in an extremely awkward position it became necessary to send bridging material, assault boats and ""Fantails"" on transporters to enable neighbouring formations to cross the R Po thus placing a quite unexpected strain both on the road and Havildar BHANBIR THAPA's Section.   Undauted by the magnitude of the problem the Havildar with patience and skill accomplished the task.   Havildar BHANBIR THAPA has always set an outstanding example to all  under his command and to those around him.   By his untiring efforts, initiative and cheerfulness he has on all occasions inspired his men to attain a very high standard of efficiency, resulting in the successful completion of the tasks allotted to them.

On 22 Oct 1944, 68 bags of Christmas mail bound for the UK from troops in CMF were stolen from a train at FRATTAMALORE.   Although this theft was not reported to Sgt Bennett until 24 October by his unremitting efforts he was able to trace five of the thieves and recover a considerable amount of the stolen mail.   By his example of unflagging energy over a long period, he has inspired the NCO's under him to constant effort to overcome and outwit the very real menace of the civilian Black Marketeer and Saboteur.

Citation for BEM:  On the 30th June, 1945, whilst a heavy and treacherous sea was running at a bathing beach near NAPLES, a person swimming about 75 yards off-shore was seen to be in difficulties.   Sergeant Dew, who was present on the beach, realising that the chances of the person saving himself were remote, immediately undressed and swam out towards him.   Before he could reach the spot, however, the man had disappeared.   At the same time two other swimmmers were also to be seen in difficulties.   Sergeant Dew at onec swam towards them and succeeded in reaching one man, who he conveyed to shallow water, where other resucers took the man ashore.   Sergeant Dew then returned to the heavy seas and succeeded in rescuing the other man, who by this time was on the point of drowning.   Sergeant Drew's action was most commendable, and although he is a very strong swimmer, the state of the sea, with its dangerous under currents, was a severe test, and his prompt and gallant action undoubtedly saved the lives of the two rescued Italian Soldiers.

Citation for BEM:  A/WO I (RSM) Pearce, 105 (Army) Provost Coy has served successfully and gallantly throughout the entire Sicilian and Italian campaigns, and previously in the Western Desert and Cyrenaica, as a Section Sjt in a Div Pro Coy.   During this long period RSM Pearce has devoted himself so untiringly to his duties wherever he has been stationed that he has overcome time and again many difficult situations.   By his tact and conciliatory but firm methods the discipline of British and Allied troops has always been maintained in the area under his control.   Further, he has during this period, and in particular since Jan 1945, in addition to his normal duties as RSM been responsible for conducting a number of successful investigations involving civilians.   Throughout his service, his work and conduct have been of the highest order;  his untiring efforts towards the maintenance of discipline and the prevention of crime and his fine example have always been an inspiration to those under him.   He has made a substantial contribution towards successful policing in the Eighth Army, both in operational and disciplinary roles.   I can speak from personal knowledge of the work of RSM Pearce since Oct 1941, and strongly recommend him for the British Empire Medal in recognition of his continued outstanding service.

CAEN October 1944.   Rape and attempted Murder of two French girls by American coloured troops.   With no information, the case a week old, Bell commenced his enquiry at CAEN.   He pursued it with great persistency, trailing the offenders through FRANCE, BELGIUM, and HOLLAND and with but the flimsiest of evidence arrested them near ARNHEM, proved the case and obtained conviction.   DEAUVILLE December 1944.   Bell here played a big part in breaking up a gang of deserter-racketeers, arresting 12 soldiers and 19 civilians.   All the racketeers were armed and vigorously resisted arrest.   He set an excellent example to other members of the section throughout the case, always choosing the most dangerous tasks himself.   The successful completion of this investigation, for which he was so largely responsible, resulted in the breaking up of the largest Black Market racket, in the British Area in FRANCE.  W.D. Property to the value of 11,000 was recovered and the total preventative value was may times that amount.   CAEN January 1945.   Bell took charge of a difficult investigation into a succession of Rape cases.   He showed great persistence in his enquiries and arrested the offender on a description of the vaguest nature.   Many outstanding performances could be quoted.   His zeal and efficiency throughout was  an excellent example to those who served with him.

Throughout the enitre period the standard of efficiency set by this Warrant Officer has been most praiseworthy.   His sense of duty and loyal service, which at all times precluded any thought of himself, has been to a very great extent responsible for maintaining the high standard of efficiency and discipline in the Company.   During the advance across EUROPE RSM RAMSAY, on many occasions under shell fire, scrupulously supervised the work of his various Sections working in support of the leading Brigades, thus ensuring that the Brigades were at all times well served, and further, that the Sections were never in want for essential equipment necessary to carry out the tasks which were allotted to them.   In particular during the breach of the bridgehead in NORMANDY, and later when the SIEGFRIED LINE was penetrated in Operation VERITABLE, when weather conditions were appalling, RSM RAMSEY's initiative ewnabled the vast movement of wheeled traffic to maintain and even flow.   In looking ahead at all times, signs and equipment were always available to meet the unexpected.   Later when 15 (s) Division assault crossed the RHINE and ELBE the provost resources were stretched to the maximum, RSM RAMSAY by his cheerfulness and encouragement of all who worked with him, all knowing that he would accept nothing less than the highest standards.

At no time has the Provost Coy lacked stores or equimpent, due entirely to this NCO's foresight and hard work.   He invariably placed the interest of the Coy above his own and under the most trying circumstances worked without a thought for his own safety or comfort.

In September 1944 during the advance through HOLLAND to NIJMEGEN Sergeant Fisher was detailed to establish a traffic post in St OUDENRODE, HOLLAND with orders to ensure the smooth flow of traffic through the town along the road which was the only route by which the British forces were advancing and could be maintained.   The traffic post was duly established on 19 September, and all went well until the leading Armoured Division had passed through, when on 22 September the route was cut by substantial German forces just north of the town.   This occurred in the late afternoon at a time when traffic was held up which caused considerable congestion in St OUDENRODE.   Almost at once shells began to fall in the town causing casualties to the stationary vehicles and heavy firing was heard outside.   As the shelling continued and increased in violence Sergeant Fisher took steps on entirely his own initiative to disperse the traffic by moving from vehicle to vehicle and ordering and guiding drivers to pull into the side streets and back yards.   But this was no easy matter as several were now in flames and drivers of others had taken cover.   There can be no doubt that but for the example and complete disregard for personal safety of Sergeant Fisher the casualties  to both vehicles and personnel would have been considerably higher and furthermore, by his leadership he gave confidence to the drivers when the situation was most confused and rumours of the most alarming nature were abundant.   Many hours passed before the Germans were cleared from the road and the shelling ceased, but during the next few days they succeeded in cutting the route on more than one occasion and each time the same conditions arose in St OUDENRODE, but throughout this particularly trying period Sergeant Fisher, by his coolness, leadership and devotion to duty was a source of inspiration to those under his command and all with whom he came into contact.

During this time the Provost Company played a vital role necessitating long and continuous hours of duty frequently under fire.   Throughout all these operations RSM Ward displayed a keenness and efficiency which were outstanding.   Particularly during the final clearing of the West bank of the Rhine at XANTEN and during the difficult period of mounting the operation for the assault across the Rhine he, in the unavoidable absence of the Junior Company Officers, carried out with complete success duties far in excess of those which he would normally be called on to undertake.   Under similar circumstances he was again called upon to exercise his ability in the operations which ended in the successful capture of BREMEN.   During all these operations RSM Ward displayed a complete disregard for his own safety and by ensuring that orders were intelligently carried out and operations were full supported he displayed courage and efficiency of the highest order.

His efficiency, devotion to duty, and unstinting self-sacrifice has enabled us under almost impossible conditions to use these methods of Crime Detection with great success.   His unquestionable ability, and his willingness at all times to assist others, has earned him the respect and appreciation of all who served with him.   No case was ever too big or too small for him.   The persistancy of his work during the period stated has resulted in the detection of hundreds of crimes, ranging from Murder, Rape and War-Crimes to Larceny.   He is a brilliant detective and  has been an inspiration to all who have sought his assistance.  An outstanding example of his work was the suspected murder of a soldier at Eindhoven on the 26th April 1945.   With this knowledge of Ballistics, a masterpiece of crime-reconstruction and cleverly selected photographs of the reconstruction, he was able to prove beyond doubt, that the soldier died of his own hand.   Thereby removing strong suspicions that rested on certain personnel of this soldiers's unit.

During the retirement of the rear guards from DENDRE a column of refugee carts escaped from a refugee park on the side of the main road to be used by the rearguards.   Hardly had this situation been found by a small GHQ party before it was in turn found by a squadron of enemy bombers.   It was subjected to 30 minutes of continuous bombing.   At the first salvo most of the cart drivers abandoned their carts and amidst burning cars and upturned carts the frightened horses looked like blocking the road.   The small party in which Lance Corporal Rounce was conspicuous through the bombing, cut wounded and dead horses out and led them away into a field.   Later during a heavy dive bombing raid at WATTEAU Lance Corporal Rounce was on point duty and remained at his post doing excellent work throughout.

Arthur Clare Reeve Radford was on duty during the retreat from Dunkirk.    The bridge he was guarding had been rigged with explosives ready to be destroyed, and the approaching road had been mined.   Radford was told of a wounded soldier in the path of the advancing Germans.   He rode his motorcycle across the bridge and down the road, returning with the wounded man draped across the bike, moments before the bridge was blown.

Corporal Laing has been in the Highland Division Pro Coy for over 3 years, and has served in all the battles from EL ALAMEIN to the German defeat, with coolness, cheerfulness and gallantry.   An experienced NCO he was section Corporal attached to a Brigade in the Divisional attack on the SIEGFRIED LINE defences, west of the RHINE and later in the assault crossing.   The success of the operations in both cases depended on the accurate and comprehensive road and traffic control and in carrying out this task Corporal Laing had displayed the greatest determination, coolness and disregard for danger.   He was responsible for lighting certain of the tracks for Buffaloes (amphibious tracked troop carriers) in the RHINE CROSSING from assembly area to water's edge.   This task had to be carried out without fail by a certain time after dark.  
Failure would have had an adverse effect on the operation.   The task was successfully accomplished by Corporal Laing under heavy enemy fire.   This NCO can be depended upon to use his initiative under hazardous conditions and to handle swiftly any awkward situations that arise.   His disregard of danger, his resource and his unfailing sense of duty were of the highest order.

He landed in France on D+1, and at once showed standout qualities of initiative, leadership and devotion to duty.   Working very long hours, frequently under shell fire and bombing, his example to and control of his Sect were beyond praise.   Wounded on 9 Jul at CAEN he was eager to rejoin his Coy and was back in early Sept, in time to undertake with great success independent Pro work in advance of formations on the long march from Le Havre to Belgium, normally only done by a Pro Officer.   During the last three months in Belgium and Holland he has with marked success commanded a detached sect; and, unsupervised by officers, has constantly had to act on his own.   Throughout the period his quick judgement, initiative and cheerful acceptance of any duty under however great difficulties has been an inspiration to all ranks of his Coy, and has often had a steadying and encouraging effect on other troops.

L/Nk GILLU RAM was one of the patrols detailed to watch all the Railway Stations along the Karachi-Hyderabad line and on the 3rd Nov. 1943 was responsible for the arrest of Babu Khan.   He was dressed in Mufti at the time and was able to close on Babu Khan without the latter realising that this was a Military Policeman.   When within a yard or two, however he was recognised by Babu Khan and the latter, who is a particulary bad type of Pathan immedately drew out a 'Pathan Knife' and attacked L/Nk Gillu Ram.   This NCO was unarmed at the time, but acting with great courage and determination, picked up a woodman's axe which was lying on the platform.   He defended himself with this and inflicted a leg injury on Babu Khan.   Despite this Babu Khan ran for some 50 yds before he collapsed.   The NCO then tied his hands behind his back with a 'safa' and carried him back to the Railway Station.   He there experienced further trouble.   The local inhabitants not realising that he was a Military Policeman were particularly hostile.   Fortunately a train arrived at that moment and the L/Nk. without hesitations bundled Babu Khan into the train and took him down as far as the next station where he telephone to MP HQ for a truck.   It is considered that this NCO's handling of this Pathan was most praiseworth, his display of courage and coolness of the highest degree and his withdrawl from what might have been a very awkward situation showed how unaffected he was by the whole incident.   This NCO has been detailed for serveral special investigations, during which he has been operating on his own - masquarading in various guises, and has proved himself to be perfectly cool, in all circumstances.

The men cut a hole in the barbed wire and climbed through it.   They were assisted by some Polish people who came them civilian clothes, food and maps.   The men were recaptured between SCHRODA and WRESCHEN.   In Spring 1941, BARLOW escaped alone from a cattle truck in which he was being transported across Germany.   He was travelling in the last coach of the train and managed to climb through the air ventilator and jump clear.   He was free for two days being discovered by some members of the Hitler Youth Movement, while sleeping in a wood.   Before arrival in STALAG 383 of the U.S. Forces, from 18 April 1945 to 22 April 1945 BARLOW together with several other P/W maintained order amongst the British prisoners and it is largely due to him with his companions that no shooting incidents occurred with the Germans.   When U.S. Forces drew near, these men disarmed the German guards, and took them prisoner.   Since then they have assisted U.S. Troops in guarding these Germans and have, unaided maintained order amongst the British ex Ps/W.

During the period 18 Feb - 31 May 1943 Sergeant Evans has carried out gallant and efficient work at MARETH.   Sergeant Evans was responsible for marking and lighting minefield gaps under heavy shellfire, but at no time did this deter him from completing his task in an efficient manner.   In the same area Sergeant Evans was responsible for the Traffic Control in connection with ammo dumping and it was in great part due to his efficiency that these programmes were successfully carried out night after night in the ENFIDAVILLE area. Sergeant Evans was in charge of the Pro Section attached to 153 Brigade and here again he carried out the marking and lighting of tracks often under heavy shellfire.   Throughout this period Sergeant Evans inspired his section not only by the efficient way he has tackled many difficult and dangerous jobs but also by his complete disregard for his own safety under intense enemy fire.

Assigned as a special investigating agent to aid the united States authorities at the Port of Bari, Italy, in the deterring of pilferage and theft of United States Government property occuring in that port, both aboard berthed ships and on the quays,   Sergeant Williams applied himself to the task with enthusiasm and apt intellignece which soon resulted in an alleviation of the problem.   He improvised and organized a search procedure to examine Unites States' vessels immediately on arrival at dockside, which resulted in the recovery of large amounts of Government property, and in apprehension of persons who were guilty of the depredatory acts.   In addition, he developed a system of surveillance of stevedores and port-employees from obsucure positions on the ships and quays, which also resulted in the arrest and conviction of many persons guilty of cargo pilferage.   During the period of time that he was assigned to this work, Sergant Williams displayed an interest in the security and protection of American property which was far beyond normal expectancy and his conscientious effort towards the recovery of pilfered properties, and the apprehension of those persons who were gulty of the thefts, reflects credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of the Allied Nations.

Citation for BEM:   For many weeks during the latter part of 1946 and beginning 1947, HAMBURG was subjected to a series of armed robberies and serious thefts.   It was known that most of the crimes were committed by a gang of British absentees and deserters.   Sgt GROGAN was detailed to carry out investigations to effect their apprehension.   For several weeks he worked alone and methodically followed  the smallest pieces of information.   Sometimes he spent many hours at night alone in districts renowned for their unsavoury characters.   By 8 Feb 47, Sjt GROGAN'S patient and able work had led to the arrest of all seven of those dangerous characters - some under arms.   This NCO has continously shown throughout his service with 88 SIS a determination of effort and singleness of purpose which has been the admiration of all his officers and comrades and which has led him into situations often extremely dangerous to himself.

The Non-Commissioned Officer formed the opinion that they were deserters, although they said they were in the Merchant Marine and from NAPLES.   From observations he discovered that both men were armed and as they were acting in a suspicious manner he ordered them to keep their hands in sight, and then drove to NAPLES.   On being searched, both men were found in possession of fully loaded automatic pistols.   They were then handed over to the United States Military Police who identified them as deserters from LEGHORN.   Although unarmed, Sergeant SHUTTLEWORTH succeded in arresting two dangerous armed deserters, thus preventing them carrying out ""Armed hold Ups"" an offence prevalent in the area.   It is considered that the initiative, high courage and devotion to duty of the Non-Commissioned Officer, is an example to other Non-Commissioned Officers in the Corps of Royal Military Police, and is worthy of special commendation.

During the period 12 February to 27 March 1944, in the hills north of CASSINO, this NCO was in charge of a CMP section attached for duty to 7 Indian Infantry Brigade.   Throughout a long and difficult period he set an example of courage and devotion to duty worthy of the highest praise.
The tasks allotted to the section under Sergeant  Hirst were to control traffic on the Brigade axis in the forward area, to assist in the evacuation of wounded and to act as guides whenever required.   In order to carry out this work to best advantage it was necessary for the section to live in the area of Brigade ""Jeephead"".   This area had been accurately registered by enemy artillery and mortars, and for the entire period of six and a half weeks was subject to intense concentrations of mortar and shell fire both by day and night.   Indeed the whole of the forward part of the Brigade axis was continually under heavy fire throughout this period, particularly when  there was any movement of men, mules or vehicles.   Casualties in the area were heavy.   Furthermore there was a constant stream of casualties moving back down the axis which would always attract additional enemy fire.   The work of Sergeant Hirst during this very difficult period was quite outstanding.   His duties of necessity caused him to move about when the enemy fire was heaviest.  He never once failed in his duties either in organising and carrying out traffic control or in escorting ambulances and stretcher parties.   He showed great courage, complete disregard of his own personal safety and was constantly moving about in his area of responsibility in order to encourage the other men of his section.   Traffic at night time was normally heavy and it is largely due to the determination and untiring efforts of this NCO that the Brigade axis was never seriously blocked.   His personal example was an inspiration to his section every man of which did splendid work under very hazardous conditions.   The courage and powers of leadership of this NCO were of a very high order and were worthy of the finest traditions of the CMP.

Citation for BEM:  CQMS Cook has been Chief Clerk Provost Branch, HQ Eighth Army, since August 1943, throughout the entire Italian Campaign, and previously served as a Divisional Provost Coy Clerk in the Western Desert.   During the time he has been at Army Headquarters he has been responsible for the organisation of all clerical duties and of the interior economy of this branch.   It must now be said that never during the whole of this period of one year and nine months has the efficiency and excellence of the clerical work of the branch been of anything but the very highest standard.   At all times frequently in the worst of field conditions, the clerical staff has displayed not only a high standard of work, but also the cheerfulness, application and ability for sustained effort which is so necessary for efficiency.   This teamwork, while of necessity a combined effort on the part of all ranks, was largely due to the untiring personal efforts and leadership of CQMS Cook.   The work he has handled both of the most secret operational nature and of a highly confidential type concerning the discipline of officers and men, has demanded a standard of integrity and trusworthiness second to none.   All this and more CQMS Cook has cheerfully and unstintingly supplied, and by this, together with his loyalty, he has been not just an efficient chief clerk, but an invaluable assistant and friend to all the Provost Staff Officers who have served at Army Headquarters.   For his continued good service, a lot of it beyond the call of ordinary duty, it is strongly recommended that he receive recongnition in the form of the British Empire Medal.

Although 49 years of age his example and soldierly bearing in the desert and in towns has been outstanding in a Force where such is considered of a very great importance and of the widest benefit to the troops in the Army in general.

His work involves frequent reconnaissance in forward areas coupled with long spells of duty by day and night in all sorts of conditions, and he is never satisfied until in the sector for which he is responsible all routes are more than adequately signed and columns delivered to their destinations.

On 28 February 44 Sgt Andrews of the Provost Wireless Traffic Control Section received orders to connect VILLA TP to CAIRO TP by telephone and to lay the wires anywhere.   This communication was vital in  order to warn vehicles approaching the CAIRO circuit of enemy shelling, and to allow vehicles to proceed safely through the circuit only when shelling had temporarily slackened.   The circuit is a vital link for maintenance of forward troops.   He commenced work at about 0900 hours and had completed laying the line during the morning, but owing to heavy shelling the line required continuous repairs.   For 3 days Sgt Andrews tested and repaired many cuts in the line under constant shellfire. With complete disregard for his personal safety he kept this vital communication in working order.
On the 2nd day whilst running a new section of wire from his jeep he was blown up by a mine and though considerably shaken by concussion kept up his patrol of the circuit and repairs to the telephone line that day and insisted on continuing his work next day.   He was soon after posted to command 5 Brigade Pro Unit so that, in his own words ""I could keep my eye on the CAIRO circuit"" and on 17 March he was seriously wounded in the vicinity of VILLA.   He was an inspiration to all those who worked under him.

His total disregard for his own personal safety and utter fearlessness under fire were always evident, but never more so than at HALLDEREN, HOLLAND IN Oct. 44., when for four days his Coy was in close contact with the enemy in dug-in positions and subjected, in addition, to sustained and accurate mortar and artillery fire.   Throughout this period, he repeatedly made his way to Bn HQ with important intelligence when all other forms of communication were disrupted, and on his own inititative, constantly visited the foremost defences, encouraging his comrades, assisting with the evacuation of wounded and impressing all who saw him with this cheerfulness, indomitable courage and concern and consideration for his fellow men.   It was undoubtedly largely due to the fine example of gallantry and selflessness that the morale of his Company remained so consistently high.

The two policemen under his command, who helped him in his task, were killed by enemy shelling and Corporal Redbond had to complete his task on his own.

Citation:-   Major White has been Assistant Provost Marshal in Vienna since July 1946.   For four years he has carried out his duties in an Exemplary manner, displaying exceptional ability, judgement and tact in dealing with the many incidents involving British Troops, Austrians, or members of other Occupational Forces.
He displayed these qualities in a marked manner on 22 August 1949 when, in a British Sector of the city, a hostile Austrian crown was about to attack a Russian Vehicle in which an Austrian subject was being transported against his will.   His firm handling of the situation not only freed the Austrian but dispersed the crown and thus prevented a serious incident.
Again between 24th and 28th February, 1950, his firm and tactful action prevented Soviet attempts to search the British European Airways omnibus proceeding to and from the British Airfield.
He has rendered service of a high order for a long period under difficult conditions;  throughout which he has retained the confidence and respect of all nationalities and ranks.

On the 10th September 1916 whilst a railway van was being unloaded at the Base Port and was about two-thirds full a shell exploded killing one man, wounding several others and setting the ammunition boxes on fire.   A chemical fire engine was quickly brought to the scene, but it was necessary for someone to enter the burning van with a hose to extinguish the fire.   This S/M CHARLESWORTH did on his own initiative thereby averting what could probably have been a very serious disaster.   Additional pension of 6p per diem recommended should he be ultimately discharged to pension.

On the 28th, 29th and 30th March, 1918, for thirty-six hours continuously, the above mentioned NCO's rendered invaluable services in keeping in the line and taking back into the line, stragglers of several Divisions, scattered by heavy shell fire coming down at the time.
This work was carried out at great personal risk, under very heavy shell fire and exceptionally difficult circumstances, with an untiring energy and devotion to duty which were above all praise.   There is no doubt that by their bravery and energy A/SSM Lelliot, Sergts. Taylor and Ashdown kept the line before Domart supplied with valuable reinforcements, which may have averted very serious consequences.

The following has been received from her husband by Mrs McKay, wife of L/Cpl McKay, of the Hull City Police:-  On the morning of the 9th April I was on traffic control duty, when the road in the vicinity of my post was being heavily shelled by enemy artillery.   The traffic at the time was heavy with all kinds of troops and transport.   Although two shells burst - one behind and one in front I am thankful to say I am no worse for my experience.   After the second shell burst a soldier who was on horse back was hit and thrown to the ground.   I immediately went to his assistance, but found he had been killed instantaneously.   I then removed him to the side of the road  clear of the traffic and then resumed my duty at my post.   On the 13th inst. I was recommended for the Military Medal.

P/80 SERGEANT A H TAYLOR
20 INFANTRY DIVISON MILITARY MOUNTED POLICE
On the 28th, 29th and 30th March 1918, for thirty-six hours continuously, the above mentioned NCO rendered invaluable services in keeping the line and taking back into the line, stragglers of several Divisions, scattered by heavy shell fire coming down at the time.   This work was carried out at great personal risk, under very heavy shell fire and exceptionally difficult circumstances, with an untiring energy and devotion to duty which were above all praise.   There is no doubt that by their bravery and energy A/SSM Lelliott, Sergeants Taylor and Ashdowne kept the line before Domart supplied with valuable reinforcements, which may have averted very serious consequences.

On the 28th, 29th and 30th March, 1918, for thirty-six hours continuously, the above mentioned NCO's rendered invaluable services in keeping in the line and taking back into the line, stragglers of several Divisions, scattered by heavy shell fire coming down at the time.
This work was carried out at great personal risk, under very heavy shell fire and exceptionally difficult circumstances, with an untiring energy and devotion to duty which were above all praise.   There is no doubt that by their bravery and energy A/SSM Lelliot, Sergts. Taylor and Ashdown kept the line before Domart supplied with valuable reinforcements, which may have averted very serious consequences.

Citation: Detective Corporal Joseph Coxon, (Already in possession of MSM).
At PARIS on the 12/3/1919 this NCO in company with No. P7932 L/Cpl WEBSTER, B, MFP had a desperate affray with two deserters.   One of the latter used a revolver freely, tow of the shots taking effect on L/Cpl Webster and causing his death.   COXON showed the greatest of gallantry and it was solely owing to his exertions that these two men were eventually arrested.   His action was all the more meritorious as although wounded in the arm he nevertheless pluckily continued the chase although being fired at freely.
     This is not the first occasion on which this NCO has shown great courage and coolness in face of danger.   He has frequently been in very awkward positions but has always emerged with the utmost credit to himself.
He is fully deserving of a high award.

472 ACTING/SQUADRON SERGEANT MAJOR M W HEALEY
MILITARY MOUNTED POLICE
Extract from V Corps Routine Orders dated 13/2/18.
The Corps Commander wishes to express his appreciation of the following act of courage on the part of No. P/472 A/SSM M W Healey, MMP.
On the morning of the 10th inst, a pair of horses attached to a wagon bolted down the road.   A NCO made an attempt to stop them but failed, A/SSM Healy with great promptitude and at much personal risk dashed in and seized the reins of the near horse and hung on until he had brought the runaways to a standstill.   The road was used by a considerable amount of traffic and the prompt action of this Warrant Officer averted what might have led to a  serious accident and damage to a pair of Government horses and the limber.   A record of the above will be made in the Regimental Conduct Sheet of this Warrant Officer in accordance with para 1919 (XIV) of King's Regulations.",,250,

Citation:  Major Rawlings became DAPM 1 Commonwealth Division in Feb 1952,   During the whole time he has held the appointment he has spared no effort to ensure that discipline within the Division has been maintained to a high standard.
     He has been faced with many difficult situations due to the different disciplinary codes of the Commonwealth contingents.   By his tactful handling and his own high standards these difficulties have been overcome.
     By close personal liaison he has established excellent relationships with the America authorities.   This aspect has been of the greatest importance in the maintenance of discipline.
     Many of the Provost personnel have been young and inexperienced, but by his own determination and drive he has succeeded in moulding them into a smart and efficient company.
     His personal example and devotion to duty under difficult conditions has been outstanding and fully merit recognition by the appropriate reward.

Citation:  On the 28th March, 1918, this NCO was in charge of a battle stragglers' post at Cayeux.   He kept his post there until it became necessary to withdraw successfully to Ignscourt, Demuin, Hangard and Domart.   Sergt. Hooton was told to decide when it was necessary to withdraw his post and he showed a high sense of duty in remaining on in each place until shelling made it practically impossible to deal with stragglers.   This NCO did very good work and handed over several hundred stragglers each day to Brigade Headquarters.

Cpl Lee gained access to the roof through the trap door of a small wooden structure which stood about seven feet high above the roof.   From there he could see the man lying about twenty feet away astride the roof.   He was unable to use his hands and appeared to be in great danger of falling off.   Without hesitation Cpl Lee sung himself over the edge of the wooden structure and was lowered to the roof.  He then inched his way along to the man.   When Cpl Lee reached him the soldier tried to put his hands on Lee's shoulders and looked as though he would grapple with him.   With extreme calmness Cpl Lee put the soldier's hands back on the roof, gave him a cigarette and sat talking to him.   After a few minutes Cpl Lee dragged him back to the wooden structure, got himself behind the man and hoisted him up the side of the box so that he could be pulled in through the trap door.   The roof was sixty feet high and only six inches at its apex.   It had been raining hard, the roof was very cold and slippery.   By showing complete disregard for his own safety and great courage Cpl Lee averted an almost certain tragedy.   The Commander-in-Chief directs that an entry should be made in the Regimental Conduct Sheet of the above named in accordance with Queen's Regulations paragraph 1633 (0).

CORPORAL JAMES SMITH
MILITARY MOUNTED POLICE
The King has been pleased to award the Albert Medal to Lieutenant (acting Major) William Revell Smith, MC, RFA, Sergeant Alexander Gibson, Royal Engineers, and Corporal James Smith, Military Mounted Police, in recognition of their gallantry in endeavouring to save life at Wizernes in January last.   On the 17th January, 1919, a fire occurred at the brewery at Wizernes.   In the engine room a Frenchman, whose cries for help could be heard, had been entombed by a fall of masonry which completely blocked the entrance.   The upper part of the building was blazing fiercely, and the only entrance to the engine room was by a small hole in the wall which carried the machinery belting.   Major Smith, Sergeant Gibson, and Corporal Smith succeeded in making their way through this hole into the room, and worked for three quarters of an hour before they exposed the head and shoulder of the entombed man, who was found to be dead.
They undoubtedly risked their lives in endeavouring  to save life, for a further collapse of masonry (which appeared imminent) would have completely cut off their exit.",,,

Cpl Guest at once took charge, rendered intelligent first aid, and, appreciating that the wounds needed immediate Medical attention, drove the DR to the nearest RAP, through continuous shelling.   The MO's later report left no doubt that Cpl. Guest's cool and prompt action saved the DR's life.   The DR had said that the messages he carried were of great importance, and Cpl Guest took them and drove forward again through shell fire, and delivered them to their destinations.   Cpl Guest landed in France soon after D Day, and his record throughout the campaign for devotion to duty under all circumstances has been exemplary.

It was therefore decided to push a Bn of the reserve Bde through the WEST side of the village at dawn on the 27 June to seize a commanding feature SOUTH of the village.   On the morning of 26 June Sgt ALSOPP was detailed to set out with an officer of the Bde concerned to recce a route across country through FONTENAY by which the Bn could move up.   This recce was carried out successfully as far as FONTENAY, but the battle was raging in the streets and it was impossible to continue through the village to the SOUTH side.   At 20.00hrs on the evening of 26 June Sjt ALSOPP set out once more to mark the route with coloured lights,   The whole of the area was being heavily shelled and mortared, and FONTENAY itself was on fire.   Unperturbed, Sgt ALSOPP marked the route right up to the village, and was then faced with the task of completing the route through FONTENAY and to the SOUTH, over the ground he had been unable to recce that morning.   The village was under extremely heavy enemy shelling and mortaring, and spandaus were firieng down the street.   Enemy tanks were known to be operating.   With complete disregard of his own personal safety, Sjt ALSOPP moved forward by bounds over completely unknown ground, marking the route through the orchards surrounding the houses until he reached the objective given.   Then, realising the extreme likelihood of the lights being extinguished either by shell fire or enemy patrols Sjt ALSOPP did not return to his HQ, but for the rest of the night moved along the route he had marked, checking and rechecking the lamps,  heedless of the enemy mortaring and the extreme danger that accrued from the proximity of enemy fighting patrols.   Three hours before dawn the Bn for which he had marked the route moved up in complete darkness, without a man straying from the route.   At dawn the Bn had reached its forming up area and soon after the attack went in.   The success of that extremely difficult night move across unknown country was almost entirely due to Sgt ALSOPP's bravery and selfless devotion to duty in marking and maintaining the route despite the most difficult and dangerous conditions.

Citation for Croix de Guerre with Bronze Star:   The above NCO with his section of Military Police was detailed under a Provost Officer, for duty with the 4th Armd Bde when that Bde had crossed the ORNE and was pushing south towards FALAISE.   During this period when his men were for the first time serving under dangerous conditions, he continued to visit and encourage them.   One of the NCO's was posted at a cross roads which was subjected to more frequent shelling and mortaring than other points..   He repeatedly visited his NCO and eventually returned to the point and remained there until orders were given for the pointsmen to be withdrawn    Later Sjt SIMMONDS was attached with his section of Police to a Bde of 15 (S) Div when it was about to cross the river SEINE at LE MUIDS.   It was necessary to post two Military Policemen at different points on the banks of the river on the night before the crossing was made.   One of these points had been under sporadic enemy small-arms fire during the preceding day, and both points were isolated for several hours during the night.   Sjt SIMMONDS again displayed a keen sense of duty in visiting these pointment, constantly until it was evident that the positions had ceased to be dangerous.   Circumstances had placed this NCO on some of the most dangerous assignements which the company have had to perform and he has on all these occasions shown a devotion to duty which were of the highest traditions of the Corps of Military Police, and which has proved an excellent example to those serving under him.

Citation for BEM:  As a result of allegations made in the local press that relations between the Chinese population of KUANTAN and the Coy of 2 Malay Regt, KUANTAN were in a very bad state due to the bad behaviour of the latter, a small Detachment of RMP were sent by air to KUANTAN on 16 Dec 48.   Included in this party was 22212008 SGT WALFORD D. S. (then a L/Cpl).   This NCO had received instructions from me that he was to assume the role of a civilian and to circulate the town with a view to obtaining first hand opinions of a cross-section of the Community.   Under arrangements made with the local police, SGT WALFORD assumed the indentity of a visiting free-lance journalist, and was accommondated at the local Rest House.   KUANTAN is a notorious bandit area, and to carry out his task this N.C.O. had to visit many places which were both isolated and dangerous.   In the duty this N.C.O. had to carry out dressed as a civilian, it was deemed unsuitable that he should carry arms.   He was therefore at all times completely unarmed.   SGT WALFORD has a very wide knowledge of the inhabitants of this area and as a result he submitted a report of a very high order which cast much light on the cause of this trouble.   This was having serious repercussions on the relationship between the Army and Civilian population.   The report was full and detailed and contained many constructive criticisms and suggestions which were of extreme value not only from the point of view of the Disciplinary aspect of the case, but had a direct bearing on the successful continuation of operations in the area.  At the conclusion of his investigation I received high praise on his behalf, from the District Commissioner and also the Officer Commanding the Police District.   His report was submitted to the G.O.C. Malaya Dist who considered it to be extremelty valuable.   The G.O.C. commended WALFORD personally for his work.   This N.C.O. during the whole of his tour of duty shewed great initiative and drive, working without any outside assistance under conditions of considerable danger and difficulty.   As a result he produced a report which resulted in greatly improved morale in the KUANTAN area.   During the whole period of the emergency this N.C.O. has shewn great initiative and keenness and has consistently proved to be outstanding both as a policeman and a N.C.O.   I recommend that his name is submitted for the B.E.M.

He has been largely responsible for organising Special Investigation Branch Administration throughout the Theatre.   His application to this task has proved to be outstandingly effective.   It is largely due to his efforts that co-ordination with the American system of Police Investigation has been accomplished with satisfactory final results in many important investigations.   He has also made himself responsible for the establishing of the Special Investigation Photographic Laboratory in Pusan,   Which again has considerably increased the efficiency of Section Investigations.   In the absence of the Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal, Special Investigation Section for quite long periods of time, Sergeant GOYMER has been in charge of the co-ordination of Theatre Side Administration and has frequenly handled important information with outstanding efficiency.   His leadership and personality has proved to be and example and inspiration to his Section.   He has applied himself to his work with a zeal far beyond expectation, to the stage when his health was likely to be affected.

For the last three years he has been the Regimental Sergeant Major of 247 Pro Coy RMP in BERLIN.   In this capacity he has shown outstanding zeal, tact and loyalty to a degree not formally expected, or found, in a soldier of his rank.   He has on many occasions been called upon to handle delicate situations involving RUSSIAN military personnel or EAST GERMAN Peoples Police, where great firmness, tempered with tact, was an essential if a serious incident was to be avoided.   Although on many occasions the presence of a BRITISH officer would have been desirable, this was not always possible due to the location and unexpectedness of the event;  nevertheless RSM DIMOND's careful handling of the situation has undoubtedly, and without any loss of prestige, prevented a serious international incident.   Through example and skillful leadership he has raised the standard of efficiency of his company to a level which has elicited praise and admiration from senior officers serving with his Corps and from members of other units of a similar type elsewhere.   The standard of discipline which he has maintained within the unit by example and within the garrison by his industry and zeal has, also, been on many occasions the subject of praise from his superiors in all arms of the service.   When called upon to work long hours he has always responded without complaint, and has, voluntarily and because of his natural enthusiasm for his work, devoted most of what might fairly have been regarded as leasure time to the particular task in hand.   By his fine example, industry, tact and loyalty he has, in BERLIN, considerably enriched the reputation of his Corps and increased the respect of members of other nations and armies for his own.

At the time that he assumed his appointment the integration of the Commonwealth Military Police resources was commencing with consequent problems of command, control, operation and administration.   The implementation of the Japanese Peace Treaty created an entirely new set of policing problems in Japan.   By firm leadership and ability Lt Col LOCKSLEY succeeded in dealing with the many and varied difficulties arising from the changed circumstances.   The Provost organisation throughout the theatre is now first class and a model of efficiency.   Relations with the Japanese police are excellent and combined policing has reached a high standard of co-operation.   Lt Col LOCKSLEY's personal determination, tact, and honesty have had a decisive effect upon relations with the Japanese police and magisterial authorities.   He is personally respected and liked and this has undoubtedly resulted in lack of friction in dealing with the difficult problems of Japanese jurisdiction over Commonwealth personnel.

In less than a year Lt-Col READ, by his outstanding example, devotion to duty, and an exceptional display of personal leadership, has transformed the unit into the most efficient and contended in the District.   This fine achievement was accomplished in the face of most adverse circumstances in British personnel, material, unit accommodation and a heavy guard commitment.   Quite apart from producing an efficient and happy unit in such a short time, his personal attention to all and every detail of management of Malays, his care for their individual welfare, and the cheerful and determined way in which he personally first mastered the Malay language then associated himself with Malay customs, and thus brought out the best qualities in the race of which his unit is composed, has set a standard almost without parallel in this District.   An example which has been an inspiration to other Commanders and staff who are faced with the general problems of Malayanization of the Army in the Colony.

This NCO has served in the SIB/RMP for a period of 61/2 years, during which time he has successfully dealt with many major investigations which have resulted in the recovery of many thousands of pounds worth of WD stores and property, destined for operatonal units in the Federation as well as those destined for KOREA.   As an example of this, in January 1954 S/Sgt KNIGHT investigated a case in JOHORE involving the larceny of a WD vehicle.   This case ended with the arrest of a complete gang of receivers of stolen WD property as well as the recovery of the vehicle concerned.

It has been recognised that with only one officer, this detachment is decidedly understaffed and efforts are being made to increase it.   In addition to the normal day to day responsibilities in comparatively minor crime, Captain MACKINNON has carried out a most complicated series of investigations into fraudulent dealings in connection with Army Contractors, involving regular travels over long distances, and including two trips to the United Kingdom.   These investigations involved five major units and a very considerable amount of paper and account work, and brought to light, fraud in the region of 50,000.   His success in these cases has been due to his energy, complete devotion to duty, and his ability.   Although extremely hard worked, and almost invariably on duty over weekends, he has always been cheerful.   I consider without hesitation that he has done outstanding work, far and above the normal call of duty, and in fact beyond the physical capabilities of most officers.

He has a wide knowledge of Military Police Duties and willingly gives up his spare time to instruct his juniors.   He has on three occasions acted as Company Sergeant Major and has carried out these duties with efficiency in a most exemplary manner.

During the period of his appointment as Company Sergeant Major of 152 Provost Company, Royal Military Police, the work of this Acting Warrant Officer II has been outstanding in merit and an inspiring example to all ranks.   He ha frequently been called upon to perform duties normally undertaken by commissioned officers and he has performed these superior duties in a highly capable manner.   On account of his exceptionable ability he was especially detailed as W.O i/c Traffic Control at Yeadon Air Display in 1953 and 1954, and the Northern Command Tattoo in 1954.   The outstanding manner in which he carried out his duties on these public occasions contributed a great deal to their success.   In his normal duties he has shown skill and initiative of a high order and the merit of his performance has been of inestimable benefit to the reputation of the Royal Military Police.

He has had a most difficult task as a Staff Sergeant Royal Corps of Military Police and in respect of these duties alone he has done a job far and away beyond the standard and normal requirements of his appointment.   He has had many most difficult, complicated, and at times dangerous, tasks to carry out and all these he has performed in a quite outstanding manner which has been an inspiration to all those with whom he has come in contact.   He has worked long hours with cheerful optimism and unfailing zeal which has accomplished first class results.   He has personally instituted close co-operation and confidence with the local police in their work which entirely by his own inititative has had most valuable results.   Recently he has had the organisation of a special detached party and has had a task to perform which would normally be given to an officer.   Again he has shown an outstanding ability and zeal which have been a credit to the Army as a whole in the area concerned, and has achieved most important results.   His high sence of duty, his keenness, energy and ability have been of the most outstanding order and his work recently has well earned him especial recognition by Her Majesty The Queen.

The DAPM SIB Far East Land Forces is often absent from Singapore on duty and during the period under review was in the UK on leave for a period of six weeks.   During these absences of the DAPM Lieut Sharman efficiently and enthusiastically takes over the DAPM's duties as well as continuing with his own.

He will happily accept any task requied of him and will persue investigations ruthelessly, regardless of personal fatique or discomfort, showing considerable tact and intelligence, invariably producing clear and complete reports.   Due to his keeness, tenacity and efficency, he has confronted many criminal activities in his area and has personally  been responsible  for recovering stolen Goverrment property, in one case in October past the property recovered amounted to 7,000.

LITTLEBOY has been APM of this Div.   It was in no small measure that due to his diligence and devotion to duty in Feb this year, the Div less 99 Bde, carried out the long, strategic move from IMPHAL to the IRRAWADDY RIVER with such ease.   He had many difficulties to contend with:  the period under review saw the transition of the Div from a standard one to a 100% two-mechanised Brigade - One; (the third Bde even being fully mechanised with improvised MT in later stages).   In addition one Armd Bde less a Regt augmented the force.   When the time came for the Div to marry up with 255 Tk Bde, cross the river and commence its dash across enemy occupied territory for MEIKTILA, it was Maj LITTLEBOY'S consistently good provost arrangements that enable the road movement and traffic control to work smoothly.   The entire force had to be  moved frequently in one day, through enemy occupied country alon one road.   The credit for the success of this both in the IRRAWADDY -MEIKTILA phase and MEIKTILA - SOUTHWARDS, must go to the Provost services for the excellence of their control as exemplified by the APM.   imperturbable under fire, always cheerful, he set a fine example and by his utterly tireless good nature, richly deserves the award for which he is now recommended.

Citation:  In his capacity as NCO in charge of a detachment of the Special Investigation Branch, Royal Military police in 70 (EA) Infantry Brigade area, which covers parts of Mount Kenya and the Aberdare forests, Staff Sergeant COE has, for the past two years given outstanding service.
     
     He arrived at a time when, as a result of publicity over certain allegations of a criminal nature, the aspect of discipline on operations was causing some uneasiness with units.   his manner and methods of investigation and his approach to such matters soon dispelled this uneasiness, which resulted always in the fullest co-operation between the unit and the NCO's of his detachment.
     By his devotion to duty, tact, and determination he has handled difficult enquiries with marked success, and has never spared himself in his efforts to investigate thoroughly and impartially any case, while still fitting in with operational commitments of units.   These investigations have invariably necessitated continuous enquiries under arduous conditions in areas frequented by Mau Mau terrorists, in which Staff Sergeant COE has shown complete disregard for his personal safety in getting the job done.   On one occasion when accompanied by an NCO of his detachment on enquiries, he was fired on by terrorists from an ambush position when visiting the operational unit at NYERI area.   He returned fire which shattered his vehicle windscreen and later assisted troops in rounding up remnants of a local gang.
     Staff Sergeant COE is an outstanding investigator and has the marked ability to co-operate successfully with senior officers of the Kenya Police Criminal Investigations Department and Special Branch, which has been invaluable to his superiors.   His understanding of African other ranks has been of the highest order.
     As a result of his efforts over the last two years, and his leadership and willingness to accept responsibility, Staff Sergeant COE and his NCO investigators are held in the highest respect by Staff of Brigade Headquarters and the Commanding officer of the unit.

Time and again he has been first in the field when trouble has started and used his handful of police to nip an ugly situation in the bud, shepherd servicemen out or away from the riot centre, inform the police and (later) the stand by infantry company.   he has had a flair for anticipating trouble and by bold leadership has instilled it in his men;  moreover for most of last year, before police radio cars and adequate troops were available, the bulk of reconnaissance regarding riots was undertaken by Major HORE personally or his men and on his information alone was action taken time and again.   During the process he ran many risks of rough handling and often got it.   he now controls some four times as many military police on the island as heretofore without and increase of status or staff and has risen to the occasion splendidly.

For the past fourteen months the Unit has been without a Warrant Officer Class I, and it has been necessary for Sergeant ROBBINS to carry out the duties and responsibilities of the Regimental Sergeant Major, over a period which included very important preparatory training for a full scale Divisional Exercise, the movement of which was largely controlled by the Provost Company.   As the senior Provost non-commissioned officer it has been necessary for Sergeant ROBBINS to carry out a good deal of liaison with the Civil Police Forces, from whom he has received high praise.   He devotes the whole of his spare time to the Unit, and during the past two years, besides carrying out his duties by day, he has also attended training on an average of five evenings a week.   his outstanding example and devotion to duty has been an inspiration to all ranks with whom he has come into contact.

One bomb exploded on the road, one failed to explode and the third bomb fell into the rear of the vehicle.   As this bomb bell, L/Cpl SMITH , also a passenger in the rear of the vehicle, saw the fuse burning and shouted a warning.   At this stage, L/Cpl WELSH was sitting on the off-side of the vehicle facing inwards and the bomb landed on the near-side, exploding almost at once.   As a result of the explosion the driver and passenger in the front were both slightly wounded.   L/Cpl SMITH who was in the rear of the vehicle with L/Cpl WELSH was seriously wounded and blown out ot the vehicle.   L/Cpl WELSH was later found dead and badly mutilated lying in the back of the vehicle.   Among many other injuries, L/Cpl WELSH had had his right hand blown off and the stump of his army was badly burnt and charred.   At the Inquest, held at FAMAGUSTA on the 14 May 56, Mr Special Justice James P TRAINOR stated ""my conclusion is that  WELSH , seeing the bomb just behind the passenger seat of the truck, instead of trying to escape from the truck, rushed to the bomb to throw it away, seized it in his right hand and the bomb exploded.   I believe that in a heroic attempt to save his companions he met a hero's death.   his body absorbed, I imagine, most of the destruction of the bomb and so the occupants of the cab were saved.

In order to achieve the best results from his work it has been necessary for Captain GRISS to establish working relations with the Civil Police Forces, the officers of the Directorate of the Army Legal Services and the Royal Army Pay Corps.   This he has achieved to a marked degree, which is reflected by the high regard which he is held by all his associates.   He has conscientiously and painstakingly carried out numerous complicated investigations which have necessitated his working abnormally long hours;  often well into the night recording statements from civilian witnesses who were not available at normal times.   At all times he has shown a complete disregard for his own personal convenience.   In order to present lucid and unbiased reports to his superiors it has been necessary for Captain GRISS, particularly in cases of suspected fraud and falsification of accounts, to carry out detailed and complicated background research.   his completed reports invariably shown an unprejudiced and accurate picture of the matters under investigation, and have greatly facilitated the disposal of disciplinary cases within the Command.   The numerous investigations which he has carried out have resulted in the recovery and saving of large amounts of both public and regimental monies, and his ready co-operation with Commanding Officers and unit adjutants has been a considerable factor in the maintenance of good discipline.

Similarly his advice has helped many warrant officers and sergeants.   his bearing. turn out, conduct and devotion to duty are an outstanding example to all ranks.   he runs a first class Sgts' Mess in which he has made many improvements and has helped to foster an excellent spirit.   In the same way his management, as President of the Corporals' Club, has produced very fine results.   His liaison with WOs and Sgts of other units is very good and does much to foster good relations between the military police and the rest of the Army.

Citation:  WO II SPICK has been in charge of the SIB detachment in MALTA for some two and a half years and during his time his work has been outstandingly successful.
Many of his investigations would have been covered elsewhere by experienced officers but he has accepted the heavy additional responsibility and has shewn that he is fully capable of performing duties far above those normally expected from soldiers of his rank.   By his tactful manner and personal ability he has gained the confidence and trust of high ranking officials, both service and civilian, in MALTA.   As a direct result of this he has been called upon for assistance much more often than is the case in the average SIB unit.   In particular, on a number of occasions very senior officers of the Royal Navy have requested his help in difficult investigation of a disciplinary nature.   All this has resulted in his being frequently grossly overworked and it has entailed his working extremely long hours both day and night.   He has not, however allowed this to interfere with the very high standard of his work.   Indeed he has, bgy the success of his efforts, merited the personal congratulations of the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, the General Officer Commanding Troops, MALTA and many other senor service officers.   WOII SPICK has made a notable contribution to the maintenance of good discipline in MALTA and has enhanced the high reputation of his Corps.   He has displayed an outstanding degree of responsibility an a sense of duty far above the average for his rank.   His fine achievements in the past two and a half years,  his magnificent example to all ranks and his selfless devotion to duty were well-known to those who have served in MALTA, and are worthy of the highest praise.

Citation. 8/6/1956 to 1/7/1958.   Lieutenant Colonel Huber has been the Assistant Provost Marshal for CYPRUS District from 8 Jun 56 to date.
    For the Emergency in CYPRUS the Corps of Royal Military Police has been built up to 400.   Because of the need to supplement and underpin the local Police Force, the Royal Military Police have not only carried out their normal functions but have acted in close support of the Civil Police, particularly in the operational field.
     Colonel HUBER has advised on and had under his personal command 780 War Department Auxiliary Police of Greek and Turkish Cypriots.   These have shown complete loyalty and carried out their heavy guarding duties with thoroughness and zeal.
     The efficiency and steadfastness of these Military Auxiliary Police stems from the exceptional leadership and personal example which HUBER has always given to them under conditions of stress and danger.   In the face of a high casualty rate he has with his firmness, understanding and complete disregard for his own safety and interests, maintained the morale of his units at a particular high lever, this has also been reflected in units, both police and military, beyond his own immediate command.
    Further, his constant watchfulness, leadership and zeal has ha a tremendous effect on the discipline of the very large CYPRUS Garrison and this has helped in no small degree to maintain the high standard of discipline, turnout and morale achieved.

Citation for MBE, No. 370058, Capt. John Cadman Blakesley, 51 Indep. Inf Bde. Gp. Pro Unit, RMP.
     During the last six months Captain BLAKESLY has continued to give outstanding service as OC 51 Independent Infantry Brigade Provost Unit and the most commendable manner in which his men have carried out their difficult, and often dangerous, tasks in FAMAGUSTA has been very largely to his own enthusiasm, courage and leadership
     By a methodical and most detailed study of the town and it's inhabitants he has built up a most comprehensive fund of information which has proved to be of immeasurable value on many occasions, not only to the army but also to the civil police.   During the riots and disorders at the beginning of the year his unit inevitably bore the brunt.   He himself was always on the spot and by taking quick action with his detailed knowledge of the back streets and alley ways he was often able to contain the trouble and to stop it spreading.
     Later on following the murder of three members of the security forces the value of his extensive knowledge of the town gangs was provided as it was largely on this that police investigations were based.   Again, on the 27th April 1958, acting on his own initiative and on information which he was personally following up, he was able to arrest a man in the act of removing a parcel of four bombs from a tree in the middle of an orange grove.
     At the same time by the intelligent use of patrols in town and by being constantly on the spot himself, he has been able to reduce the number of ""disciplinary"" incidents involving troops.   The good relations existing between the troops and members of the Royal Military Police and the high esteem in which the latter are held by all ranks of FAMAGUSTA Garrison is mostly due to his personal example of firmness and fairness at all times.

These responsibilities, which are above those normally borne  by an AAG for such extended periods, he has shouldered in an exemplary manner.   The fact that he has not had the advantage of a proper staff training makes the results he has achieved even more creditable.

Citation:  Serjeant JONES arrived in Cyprus in June 1956 and was posted to the Limassol Detachment, Royal Military Police.
     During the period June 1956 to the present date this NCO has carried out his duties in an exemplary manner and for considerable periods he has commanded the detachment in the absence of an officer.
     On the 5th April 1958 during a disturbance in Hero's Square, Limassol, when several hundred servicemen became involved  in a brawl with Greek Cypriots who were throwing bottles and other missiles at them.   Sjt Jones was personally responsible for dispersing a large and hostile crowd on Cypriots by arresting the ring leader in their midst.   In addition he ordered all the servicemen to disperse to their units and to drop any potential missiles they possessed, both of which they did.   By his prompt and resolute action this NCO prevented what might have been a very ugly situation.
     During June and July 1958 this NCO was continually working duty during the inter-communal troubles in Limassol town working with the civil police.   By his selfless devotion to duty over exceptionally long hours he set a fine example to his detachment.   Through his untiring energy, organising ability, cheerfulness and personal courage he was responsible by day and night for very excellent work done by the detachment in conjunction with the military and police authorities.

Major HILL has commanded his unit for well over two years of the CYPRUS emergency, and has throughout this time been responsible for RMP Internal Security operations in the NICOSIA area.   He has established a most efficient and cordial liaison with the Civil Police and by his personal example he has ensured that the same excellent relationship exists at all levels of his command.
     In collaboration with senior Security Force officers he has planned and taken part in a great variety of arduous and difficult operations in and around the Tow.   His courage, imperturbability and practical common-sense has not only set his subordinates the finest possible example during riots and disorders, but has frequently had a calming effect on young and inexperienced NCO's when they were being subjected to extreme provocation.
     In addition to his operational work in NICOSIA, Major HILL commands a unit of almost double the normal size with detachments widely scattered throughout the Island.   By his enthusiasm, leadership and hard work he has overcome all difficulties and maintained his company at the highest level of operational and administrative efficiency.
     The CYPRUS emergency has thrown upon this officer duties and responsibilities far greater than those which would be the normal lot of an officer of his rank, and the success and reputation of the Royal Military Police in CYPRUS is largely die to this personal effort and example.

Citation:   Major RICHARDS has been Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal of Aldershot District for the past two years, and he has carried out his duties with the greatest efficiency and devotion to duty.
     The responsibilities of the DAPM in this District are considerable.   This is due, not only to the large number of troops stationed in it, but also the special place which Aldershot still holds as one of the major centere of ceremonial.   the latter includes a number of Royal occasions when Her Majesty the Queen or other members of the Royal Family visit, Aldershot, the Staff College and the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.   To those ceremonial occasions can be added the responsibility for provost arrangements at the World Pentathlon last October and security at the CIGS!s exercise at the Staff College.   On both these occasions he was specially complimented by Field Marshal Templer for the excellence of his arrangements.   Such events demand a high degree of efficiency on the part of the Royal Military Police, and on no single occasion has Major RICHARDS allowed any hitch or error to occur.
     In addition to 158 Provost Company RMP Major RICHARDS commands the only existing mounted Section of the RMP.   This Section bears a very high reputation for smartness and military proficiency.   It has also, on more that one occasion, gained considerable success at the Royal Tournament to the advantage, from the recruiting aspect of the Corps and the Army in General.
     Ceremonial is not however by any means the greatest of the DAPM's responsibilities,.   The maintenance of discipline is of paramount importance.   In view of the number of troops stationed in the District, the burden is a heavy one, and it is due largely to the drive and efficiency of Major RICHARDS that a high standards is maintained.

He has exercised infinite patience with NCO's placed under instruction from time to time, and given up a great number of what would have been leisure hours, in guiding such NCO's in report writing and investigations.   5.

During his whole army career and particularly during his service with ROYAL MILITARY POLICE, RSM TYLER has given his powers in a most outstanding and unstinting manner both as a soldier and as an SIB investigator.   This has been most noticeable during the past two years in MALAYA.   Personal discomfort and extreme inconveniences to himself when about his duties are completely disregarded.   All his efforts, very often well in excess of what may be reasonably considered necessary, are devoted to the good name of the army.   His recent excellent handling of a complicated and difficult investigation in INDIA and NEPAL is a good example of his higher than average conscientiousness and devotion to duty.   It was a lengthy investigation involving officers and had to be handled very tastefully in view of the location and the people effected.   Working virtually alone and using all his personal resoucefulness, he brought the enquiry to a satisfactory conclusion.   Maj H Armitage RMP, DAPM HQ 17 Gurkha Div.",,,

Citation for MBE:  Prior to being posted to this Division as DAPM, Major Clark had carried out similar appointments in 6 Armoured and 7 Armoured Divisions.  He consequently brought with him to this formation a wealth of specialist experience, much of which was gained during the War years.  As a result of this background Major Clark has shown himself to be an exceptional Provost Officer.   This has been emphasises in four distinct ways.   First, in the high standard which he has invariable set, Second, in hi co-operation with, and indeed instruction of, RAF Provost units on Air transported exercises;  here his tact and personality generally have been directly instrumental in helping to maintain the best possible relations with a sister service.  third, Major Clark has recently been the Field Force member of a Provost Committee which has been sitting to examine the future scaling's of Provost Units with special reference to Air portable Operations.   The recommendations put forward to this committee by Major Clark have been accepted in almost every case.    Finally, because of his loyalty and the pride which he takes in his particular duties, Major Clark works far beyond the stipulated routine hours.   Frequently he works unassumingly late at night while on many occasions he remains in station at week-ends for the sole purpose of ensuring that Provost matters are adequatly covered.   His devotion to duty is exceptional.   Major Clark is an officer with limitless enthusiasm for the task in hand and outstanding loyalty.   When Major Clark leaves the service in February 1962 both the Army and the Royal Military Police will loose and officer who, over recent years, has rendered outstanding service.

While he was PSO of this unit he raised it to such a peak that it was sufficiently operational to take to war without further training.
    When he gave up his extended service commission to take a job with a civilian firm he straight way volunteered to serve on in a TA capacity and very soon after this became Commanding Officer of the Company.   Not only has he kept this Unit up to its very high standard but he has doubled its numbers and made it in to an absolutely shown piece Company in the Area.
     In his capacity of Director of his firm he has done much more than could be reasonably expected o him to promote the interest of the TA and regular army in the district and one can quite truthfully say that he spends a major portion of his leisure time in promoting good will towards the regular and TA Armies and I cannot recommend him strongly enough.
     In all respects both in civil life and in his military duties he has shown himself to be outstanding.

     He set bout the task of reducing the Venereal Disease rate with resourcefulness, intelligence, integrity, and an immense amount of hard work and long hours.
     During  his thirteen months on this assignment he has given up much of his spare time and all his leave.   Through his efforts, his dealing with the military and civilian clinics, his tactful and firm handling of Bar and Brothel owners and managers he has managed to achieve a lever of cooperation which is quite remarkable - especially as his visits are without open Government sanction.
     The results of his long hours of work are that the weekly Venereal Disease rate has dropped from 12.4 cases to 6.6 cases a week by October 1961..   Commanding Officers pay tribute to the sterling achievement of this young Corporal who has been directly responsible for reducing the incidence rate of Venereal Disease by 50% over the last 13 months.

     He is a Provost Officer of great experience and the very high est sense of duty, and his technical knowledge of the Corps is invaluable to his superior officers.   In spite of the fact that he has not attended a staff course, he has acquired, through great personal effort, a through knowledge of staff duties, and in particular of the working of the War Office.
     Of necessity, the Provost Marshal is away on tour a great deal and as a result Lieutenant Colonel DAVENPORT has been required to shoulder heavy responsibility and take decisions on hi own, without reference to higher authority.   This he has done cheerfully and willingly, an with such success that never once has the Provost Marshal had to go back on these decisions.
     Furthermore he has been directly concerned in a number of planning and policy decisions affecting the whole future of the Corps of Royal Military Police.   These have arisen over and above his normal work as a consequence of reorganization of the Army and the transition from national service to regular.   There is no doubt that his contribution to the future structure and well-being of the Corps will prove to be a turning point in its history.
     This is a remarkable achievement and already his personal efforts reflect not only a much higher standard of training, but a marked improvement in the lot of the non-commissioned officer.
     All this has meant a great deal of patience, tact and hard work well beyond the normal call of duty, and the extra effort which he has made towards enhancing the standards and reputation of his small but important Corps deserved full recognition.

In addition to the normal duties of APM he has been personally responsible to the GOC for the patrolling and security of the sector and zonal frontiers of the British Sector.   The control and smooth running of all British traffic on the 102 mile long Helmstedt/Berlin Autobahn, including the operation of the British checkpoints at either end and the checkpoints on the sector/sector border with East Berlin and liaison with the United States, French and West German Police Forces all come under his direct guidance.
     In addition, to his work brings him in daily contact with the Soviet authorities, whilst he personally escorts on tours every distinguished British sponsored visitor who comes to Berlin, of which there are a large number.   All the work of these natures has a strong political bias and carries special responsibilities.
     Since the crisis of 13th August 1961 his duties have increased enormously and have required him to be immediately operationally available at any time of day or night for the purpose of investigating incidents of all kinds.   Many times his minute to minute observations and reports have formed the basis of our operational actions and greatly facilitated the speed of our reactions.

     In the autumn of 1956, he joined the Territorial Army and assumed command of 50 Infantry Division Provost Company two years later.   This Company was located in Detachments at HULL, SCARBOROUGH, DARLINGTON and NEWCASTLE.   Due to his unrelenting energy, keenness and enthusiasm, Major SAWYER was instrumental in welding these widely dispersed detachments into a most efficient unit with high morale and pride of unit.
     On the reorganisation of the Territorial Army in 1961 his command was split into two new units, one in YORKSHIRE and the other in the TYNE/TEES Area.   The latter was constituted as the new 50 Division/District Provost Company and the former was designated as a GHQ unit.   Major SAWYER lives in the East Riding of Yorkshire but with commendable loyalty to 50 Infantry Division TA, he resigned the command of his Company and was re-appointed as DAPM of the Division.   At great inconvenience to himself, since long travelling distances and hours of work were involved he has devoted his efforts to ensure that the newly formed 50 Division/District Provost Company reached the same high standard, both technically and administratively, as his old unit.

This warrant officer's personality and influence is reflected in the high standard of the Company's turnout, bearing and goo relations with the Garrison units an large German civilian Police Force in Berlin.
     During the series of crises here since Aug 61, WO I Ellis has shown outstanding qualities of leadership, devotion to duty and an exceptional sense of responsibility.   The Coy has been turned out frequently and at short notice for emergencies and he has invariably been the first on parade and always eager to accept additional responsibilities.
     His fine bearing, impeccable turnout and quiet, confident manner has had a steadying influence on all ranks in several delicate and tense situations.   His keen sense of responsibility and energetic leadership has called him to visit outlying patrols and duties at considerable inconvenience to himself and more often than not over and above the normal course of duty.   The many and varied calls made upon this company, usually at short notice, have always been met and much credit has been given by senior officers.
     During the year he has been responsible for all the traffic arrangements, car parking and crowd control for the farewell parade for the outgoing GOC, HM the Queen's Birthday parade, the Military Tattoo held during the industries Fair and many other difficult and intricate special duties., all of which have been carried out with complete success.   The smoothness of his planning which involves multitudinous detail, endorse the devoted interest this WO continually displays in all aspects of his work.

     Entirely as a result of his initiative and efforts he has organised a Combined Service Bureau with which the United States Forces are linked.   This Bureau, working in close co-operation with the Civil Police and Government Social Services, has been a most important factor in the maintenance ofd improvement of discipline, well-being and health of all servicemen stationed in or visiting the Colony.   This international co-operation has been of inestimatable value and has only been achieved by the almost complete surrender of ""off duty hours"".

The train had been stopped and four of the wagons uncoupled but the fire increased and two of the wagons exploded scattering shells over a wide area.   The German Police telephoned to Minden Garrison HQ and the RMP patrol, consisting of Lance Corporal Moodie and Lance Corporal Osborn was sent to the scene.
On arrival the two NCO's were stopped by a police cordon but they were allowed to go inside the area on foot and having made an appreciation they reported to their HQ by radio and asked for Ammunition Advisers to be sent to the scene.   By this time two of the wagons were completely devastated and burning fiercely whilst the other two wagons were beginning to smoulder.   The surrounding area was covered with burning propellant, exploded ammunition and a number of dangerously hot 90mm shells which might have exploded at any time.   The girders of the burning wagons were red hot in places and there were still a number of unexploded rounds in the wreckage.   There was a large civilian house with a thatched roof withing 200 yards of the accident and despite efforts of German police a number of curious civilians were inflitrating into the area.   After some discussion Lance Corporal Moodie was able to persuade the fire brigade, who were in attendance, to move a fire tender nearer to the railway line so that it could play its hoses on to the burning wagons.   He was beginning to supervise this operation when the Ammunition Advisers arrived and Major Smith, the Officer in Charge, took control of the situation.
It was decided to move the two smouldering wagons further down the line as they were dangerously close to the large civilian house.   Despite the danger of further explosions Lance Corporal Moodie instantly climbed down to the railway tracks and helped the two RAOC Officers to uncouple the third and fourth wagons, each containing about 10 tons fo 90mm ammunition, and move them clear of the danger area.   He then helped the officers to handle the hoses and play water on the ammunition;   subsequently he assisted in controlling a fatigue party which had been called out from Minden Garrison to dispose of the ammunition after it had been examined.
Both before the officers arrived and after they had assumed control Lance Corporal Moodie acted with complete disregard for his own personal safety although he was well aware of all the dangers involved.   His behaviour and bravery over a period of nearly twelve hours was in the hightest traditions of the British Army and was a fine example to the Germans and to the other British soldiers on the scene.",,826,

Citation:   Lieutenant Colonel Buckmaster has just completed two years as APM BERLIN (British Sector).   He has carried out his duties throughout this period in an impeccable manner and in the very highest traditions of his Corp.
     The highly sensitive military and political arrangements in Berlin involve, more often that not, the RMP Company.   They are constantly on patrol around the Wire and Wall or within the City itself.   Should an incident, or even the threat of one, occur the Military Police are immediately on the scene.   The APM is invariably there soon after and on his shoulders falls the quick decision and responsibility for the first action.   On every such occasion, which are frequent in Berlin, this officer's presence always had the right effect and his decisive manner and personality time and again had the vital effect and restored the situation.
     Apart from these, sometimes daily (or nightly), episodes he was closely involved in three major situations during the last two years.
     In April 1965, West Berlin went through a very difficult five days during the sitting of the West German Bundestag in the Berlin Reichstag.   The resulting tension in the City and the closing of the autobahn placed a great strain on the RMP but Colonel Buckmaster handled the situation calmly and effectively.
     He was again, responsible for the considerable security and police arrangements during the visit of Her Majesty The Queen one month later and much of the credit for the smooth organisation must go to him.
     In April 1966 after a Soviet aircraft crashed in the British Sector of Berlin, he, personally, organised a guard on the area and dealt with the acute problems arising from the presence of senior Russian officers and on occasions Russian Troops.   This situation continued for 4 weeks and he was almost continuously on duty
     These and many other less spectacular incidents were all dealt with in the most commendable way by Colonel Buckmaster and in the words of 08 who recently visited Berlin ""The APM Berlin holds the most important and respected APM post in the British Army today"".  Colonel Buckmaster has shouldered these responsibilities during the last 2 years with resounding success.   This success can be directly attributed to his strongly developed sense of duty, his standards of integrity and a very complete knowledge of his profession.

Citation:  Captain Carrier joined the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police from the Metropolitan Police in 1943.  He was commissioned from the ranks in 1945.
     From 1945 until 1949 Captain Carrier served in Belgium and Germany.   During the Berlin airlift he was the Officer in Charge of the Special Investigation Branch in Berlin and was highly commended for his work.   He later moved to the Canal Zone in Egypt and from there to Malaya.   Whilst in Malaya during the emergency he was in charge of the Central Area Special Investigation Branch.   in 1960 he moved to HQ 1 (BR) Corps as Staff Captain (SIB) to the Assistant Provost Marshal.
     In May 1963 Captain Carrier took over command of the Southern Area Special Investigation Branch in the United Kingdom.   The area covers the whole of Southern Command and involves him in the majority of the investigations carried out in the United Kingdom.   He has shown outstanding abilities and his devotion to duty has been far in excess of the requisite qualities of his rank.   On many occasions he has assumed responsibility of a higher rank than his own.
     Captain Carrier's duties have meant his interviewing may senior officers.   His tact and manner of carrying out this duty have been such that many commendations have been received from both military and civil authorities.
     Although the Special Investigation Branch has frequently been under strength Captain Carrier's leadership and personality have resulted in first class performances by his warrant officers and non-commissioned officers.   His liaison with the Civil Police authorities is excellent, greatly assisting the good relationship which exists between Civil and Military authorities in this Command.
     Captain Carrier's enthusiasm and devotion to duty have never varied in spite of the fact that his type of commission has held out little hope of promotion.

Citation:    Over a decade, Staff Sergeant Lancaster had given distinguished service to 16 Parachute Brigade as a member of this Royal Military Police unit.   During the past three years, however, his duty as senior non-commissioned officer charged with special investigation into criminal activities has placed immense burdens on him.   Often single-handed, he has been obliged to work exceptionally long hours;  but is not alone on this count that he deserves recognition.   Staff Sergeant Lancaster has shown exemplary patience and determination as the result of which he has proved remarkably successful in bringing criminals to justice.   He has also become a byeword amongst all ranks for the sense of humanity and justice which has characterised the difficult and often depressing work that he does.
     Finally, he has on occasion been responsible for pursuing - and successfully settling - matters of national security.   Staff Sergeant Lancaster's work overall has been outstanding.   His conduct merits recognition.

     Captain METCALFE has been the Officer in Charge of BIELEFELD Special Investigation Branch Detachment for over four years.
     In the past year, he has also carried out the duties of Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal, Special Investigation Branch of the whole of the Eastern Area the British Army of the Rhine including the British Sector of BERLIN.   He has performed all these tasks, many of which have been protracted and difficult, in an exemplary manner.
     Notwithstanding that, for reasons of age, appointment to a permanent regular commission and advancement in rank have been denied to him.   Captain METCALFE has consistently and conscientiously handled a workload invariably distasteful in content - which would have daunted most police officers,military or civilian.   His loyalty and his exceptional devotion to duty, tempered with a proper sense of fairness and sympathy towards individuals in trouble, yet with a firm appreciation of the interest of the Service, have been of the highest order.
     In addition, Captain METCALFE has built up an excellent relationship with the various civil law enforcement agencies, particularly with the German Police and public prosecutors, in hi area.   Their trust and confidence in this officer is very apparent and their co-operative attitude in matters of jurisdiction and criminal procedures owe much to his work.   His personal effort in this direction have produced a benefit to the Army, which could only have been achieved by an officer of his quality, experience and determination;  and have enhanced the reputation of the Army in the eyes of the German population.
     Capt METCALFE who retires during 1968 has, by his dedication to duty, his calm and imperturbable manner, and by his outstanding professional competence, been an inspiration not only to those concerned with investigation and suppression of crime in the Army, but to many who have know him during his long years of service.

Citation:   1. Local Lieutenant Colonel PHIPPS held the appointment of Assistant Provost Marshal, Supreme Headquarters allied Powers Europe from February 1966 to July 1968.   During his period in office there have been many changes in organisation of police cover and physical security at the headquarters.
      2. From AUGUST 1966 Local Lieutenant Colonel PHIPPS, then a Major, devoted much time and thought to an extensive study of the organisation and methods of employment of the SHAPE International Police Force.   his efforts in this respect were far beyond the call of normal duty and were characterised by thoroughness, understanding, flexibility and inspired leadership.   Although he was faced with language barriers and differences in operational capability and military training of the many forces involved from 11 nations and, in many instances, the three services of these nations:  the result of his efforts was an amalgamated, highly efficient and unique International Police Force which will continue to bear his formative influence.
   3. From October 1966 to January 1967 Local Lieutenant Colonel PHIPPS served as a member of the negotiating teams in Brussels to plan the movement of SHAPE from France to Belgium.   In this capacity he played a major part in negotiations at ministerial level which resulted in well planned and highly successful systems for the special registration of thousands of privately owned vehicles and weapons, and the official documentation of civilian personnel of the headquarter.   Lieutenant Colonel PHIPPS@ pleasant and cheerful demeanour and his excellent command of the French language were extremely valuable to SHAPE in such difficult and important meetings.   In these negotiations he laid the basis for the close co-operation and harmony which exists today in relationships with several departments of the Belgian Government.
     4. He was a member of the headquarters Advance Party immediately prior to the move from France to Belgium, and during this very active period was able to establish the Provost Marshal's Officer, planning and initiating the physical security and police functions at the new location, and effecting liaison with Belgian national and local law enforcement agencies.   He was hampered by lack of manpower and proper facilities, but by enthusiasm ans special aptitude he inspired his staff to achieve a sound and efficient organisation which has been maintained.
     5. The results described have been achieved by special efforts and a display of personal qualities well in excess of that normally to be expected of an officer of his rank.   Local Lieutenant Colonel PHIPPS has earned a reputation for good humoured and powerful competence which has been the subject of much favourable comment by senior officers and officials of other NATO countries.

Citation:   S/Sgt Collins has been the senior Military Police NCO at the Autobahn Control Detachment Helmstedt since August 1966.   During this period and especially during the last nine months he has performed his duties with such loyalty and devotion as to become an inspiration to his comrades.   By his selfless example and careful attention to the administration of his isolated detachment he has been responsible for  the maintenance of high morale under difficult conditions.   He has achieved this through hard and long hours of work over and above those normally to be expected fro a person of his rank and position.
     During the absence of his OIC detachment he has cheerfully accepted the added responsibility involving decisions of international importance, the maintenance of harmonious relations with allied Forces and personal dealings with Soviet officials.
     In March 1949 there was a Berlin crisis, which caused intense activity over a ten-day period within the Autobahn Control Detachment.   S/Sgt Collins was responsible for mounting, briefing and supervising increased Autobahn Patrols, and the transmission of minute to minute situation reports to HQ Berlin and HQ BAOR.   In addition he was also responsible for the provision of facilities for representatives of the World Press, and the fostering of good Public Relations.     Above all, he was firm, good humoured and tactful in all his dealings with the Soviets throughout this serious confrontation.
     He has responded willingly to calls for his services and has unhesitatingly held himself available throughout the twenty four hours.   He has brought credit to his branch of the service and to his Nation.
     His quid decisions and resourceful actions have materially enhanced the safety and well being of allied travellers along the autobahn from Helmstedt to Berlin.
     By a display of personality, leadership, tact, firmness and unhesitating service often in adverse climatic conditions, he has made an important contribution far above that to be expected from his rank and service, towards the moral, welfare and efficiency of those under his command, and provided a vital and valued service to the Allied Forces in a post of great sensitivity.

2585,2235,173 Pro Coy,6,45262,23,1971-01-01,"1 May 1972 - 31 July 1972.   Citation BEM:   Cpl Smith was already serving in Northern Ireland when the civil disorders broke out in 1969.   He has therefore, been involved in peacekeeping operations for nearly two years without a break.
He was one of the first Military Policemen to enter, completely unarmed, the barricaded areas of Belfast into which the Army and the RUC had been refused access.   With tact, determination, and a great deal of courage he, and other NCO's of 173 Pro Coy, gradually worked themselves in, although  a tense and explosive atmosphere still prevailed.   Corporal Smith was very prominent in these manouvers, persuading the inhabitants to co-operate, with a rear combination of tact, daring and firmness.   He was particularly effective in the next more difficult step of re introducing the RUC into these areas.   Showing considerable patience and determination to achieve a large measure of success - despite frequent attacks with bottles and stones.   His influence on both military and civil police during this phase was of immense value.
In March 1970, when disorder flared up again, Cpl Smith became driver and radio operator for the officer in charge of Military Police duties in Belfast.   Throughout the ensuing Spring and Summer he drove his unprotected vehicle up to and through the most violent crowds with outstanding skill and dash.   His coolness and daring became a by-word amongst his own unit and the battalions operating in Belfast.   On a number of occasions his assessment of crowds was instrumental in enabling battalion commanders to make successful deployments.   He even talked small groups into dispersing himself. 
Throughout the period March-August 1970 he was involved in every major incident, enduring long periods without sleep or rest which could well have broken a lesser man.   Day after day he faced violent mobs, sometimes several times a day, only escaping serious injury on several occasions through good judgement, dash and a large slice of luck.
He returned to his platoon in August 1970 and was promptly embroiled in riots and peacekeeping duties until March 1971.   During this time he set an example of steadfastness, courage and determination which was an inspiration to all.   Some of the rioting was the most vicious seen in Northern Ireland with an increasing use of firearms and high explosive bombs, but Cpl Smith never complained and continued to be amongst the first to volunteer for dangerous or difficult jobs.   
In March 1971, as part of the reorganisation of the Military Police, he was appointed operations assistant at the Military Police operations room in Belfast.   Here, his quick thinking, initiative, endurance and ready wit engendered confidence in others with whom he worked and earned him the trust and respect of staff officers, civil police and soldiers alike.   His intellect and quick reactions enabled many potentially dangerous situations to be dealt with, successfully.
Cpl Smith's contribution to peace keeping operations over the last two years has been truly remarkable.   Experienced Officers and SNCO's could rightly feel proud if they had set such an example and influenced events as much.   To have maintained such spirit and courage over such a long period of sustained operations is deserving of the highest praise and is worthy of high recognition.
Citation:   A/Sergeant Smith was posted to Northern Ireland in April 1970.   he was immediately placed in charge of a section deployed in Belfast with responsibility for the policing of a very tough and intensely sectarian area into which the RUC were not allowed.   Although unarmed he carried out these duties with such determination and disregard for his own safety as to be an inspiration to his men at all times.
     on the evening of 3rd June 1970 Sgt Smith was given the task, with his section of six NCO's of controlling a very large Roman Catholic crowd confronted by an even larger crowd of Protestants.   The Protestant crown was being controlled by a strong force of RUC but they were unable to prevent frequent sallied across the road to taunt and stone the Roman Catholics.   Despite this provocation Sgt Smith succeeded in preventing any retaliation although in the process he was given some very rough treatment.   Eventually, after five hours, the crown was persuaded to leave an an extremely dangerous situation was averted.
     Again, on 28th June 1970, Sgt Smith was given the task of preventing a clash between sectarian elements at the road junction through which an Orange parade was to pass.   For this task he had only tow junior NCO's to assist him.   As the procession arrived the situation quickly deteriorated and serious rioting broke out between the rival crowds.   With a total disregard for his own safety Sgt Smith force his way through the crown to where the fighting was heaviest and talked, pushed and persuaded the Roman Catholic crowd to move back.   For thirty minutes Sgt Smith and his two NCO's prevented a major clash until riot troops arrived.   Sgt Smith then, although repeatedly his by missiles, led the riot platoon into the middle of the road between the two crowds.   There is no doubt that Sgt Smith's courageous actions were instrumental in limiting casualties and preventing a situation in which many lives could have been lost.
     Throughout his tour Sgt Smith has acted without regard to his personal safety and on numerous occasions has averted bloodshed and serious riots by his timely and courageous actions.   he has displayed characteristics of leadership and example well above those expected of someone of his rank and service.   This outstanding service should be recognised by an award.

Citation:   Staff Sergeant McQuillan was a member of 173 (Northern Ireland) Provost Company when the rioting began in August 1969.   From the outset he was committed to duties in Belfast in areas proscribed to the RUC.   Working in appalling conditions, and constantly exposed to danger, he set a splendid example to his platoon, and to the RUC with whom they worked.
     Although unarmed, because he was acting in the civil police role, he showed a complete disregard for his own safety and both supervised and carried out patrols throughout areas where even heavily armed troops were not considered safe.   His coolness and determination prevented trouble on numerous occasions and he himself was attacked on two separate occasions;  at the junction of Hocker and Disraeli Street on 28th June 1970 and in the Springfield road on 3rd July 1970.   On another occasion he was pinned own by sniper fire in the Lower Falls area.   On all these occasions he behaved magnificently.   Man situations, which would have developed into serious riots, were averted by his coolness, courage and determination.
     He worked extremely long hours and was invariably called out when major disorder occurred;  but he continued to behave in the best traditions of the service, inspiring all with whom he came into contact with a sense of purpose and devotion to duty which was instrumental in maintaining the morale of the unit.
     At all times he showed understanding and compassion to those in need of help, earning the respect and gratitude of the innocent people caught up in the disorders.   He contributed a tremendous amount towards a better understanding between ordinary people and the forces of law and order.   Although, on occasions, sorely provoked and insulted he remained steadfast in his determination to show that law abiding people had nothing to fear from the security force and proved, once again, that the British soldier is often his country's best ambassador.

He came upon a crowd surrounding a house on fire.   Nobody was attempting to enter, but hearing that here were people inside Corporal Baseley doused himself with water and tried to go in by the front door.   When flames and smoke beat him back, he tried again to enter by a bedroom window, using a ladder.   An explosion in the house threw him to the ground.
By this time his clothes were virtually destroyed and he was in a state of shock.   Nevertheless he made a third attempt, using a wet blanket for protection and was in the house when firemen arrived, hosed him down and took him outside.   He remained at the house until the fire was put out and then helped firemen in their search, finding the remains of four people.
Although in vain, his courageous conduct was an example of impartial and selfless humanity.   It was all the more praiseworthy since the mood of the spectators at the outset could have changed and put the safety of the unarmed patrol in jeopardy.",,,

Citation:   WO 1 Jones joined RMP at the age of 18 in 1946, converting to a regular engagement two years later, and when he leaves the army in October 1917 he will have 25 years unbroken service.   Promoted to acting sergeant at the age of 21 he quickly showed qualities of leadership and in addition to service with a special mobile provost section and with Jewish internment camps in Cyprus he commanded a Brigade Provost Section in Greece during the emergency, a RMP Dog Company section in Tripoli, and provost sections in Brecon, Shrewsbury, Castle Martin and Warwick before transferring to the Special Investigation Branch in 1954.  Since that time he has led SIB Detachments in East Africa, Osnabruck, Famagusta, Benghasi, Edinburgh and UNFICYP).   His work in all these posts was of a particularly high standard and at the end of his tour with UNFICYP the force Provost Marshal drew attention to his especially valuable contribution to the work of the Force in a special message to Provost Marshal (Army).
     WO I Jones took up his present post in March 1968.   Having an important and busy role Dortmund Detachment is one of seven out of eleven Special Investigation Branch BAOR detachments normally commanded by a commissioned officer, but due to a shortage of trained SIB officers Warrant Officer Jones has commanded this sub unit for virtually all of the period indicated.
     Notwithstanding that to meet further increased commitments this SIB detachment has also been reinforced in that time to become the third biggest in BAOR and many of the cases investigated under his direction in this period were of a serious nature, Warrant Officer Jones' tour in his present appointment has been outstandingly successful.   Although on call 24 hours a day his enthusiasm has never flagged and the energy he devotes to the training and welfare of his juniors is reflected in their efficiency and high morale.   His tact and close liaison with German police and other authorities has helped greatly to maintain the good reputation of troops stationed in a thickly populate area and the close co-operation he has achieved with civil investigation agencies has proved especially valuable on numerous occasions, in particular during the last six months during a period of reorganisation.   The effort he has put into all aspects of his work in this time has been far beyond the normal call of duty.   His mature sense of judgement and concern for the individual have earned him the fullest trust and respect of the Headquarters and Commanding Officers in the area his detachment served, and have much enhanced the reputation of his Corps.

Citation:  S/Sgt Brown has been in charge of the Army anti-vice team for a period of approximately one year from October 1969 to November 1970.  His is also responsible for coordinating the work of the RN, RAF, Australian and New Zealand anti-vice teams.
     The main object of these teams, which are small but hand-picked, is the control of venereal disease and the gathering of police intelligence from the City of Singapore, the latter factor being of prime importance is the prevention of serious incidents involving service personnel.   Needless to say, the tasks call for integrity of the highest order under difficult and, sometimes, dangerous circumstances.
    In his official capacity, he sometimes has to deal with both Officers and Warrant Officers under unusual and embarrassing conditions calling for the utmost tact and powers of initiative;  inevitably the circumstances, which require quick action, do not enable him to turn to his seniors for advice.
     S/Sgt Brown has carried out his duties in a most outstanding manner often at considerable personal risk as he moves through the world of gangsters and 'protection thugs'.   He has a profound knowledge of the unpleasant and sordid @underworld' in which he has to work and has gained the respect and confidence of all from Brother keepers to the hundreds of prostitutes with who he has dealings.
     The Civil authorities take no measures towards the control of VD and the degree of success we have had in tracing infected persons and their subsequent treatment has been entirely due to Brown's efforts.   His work has been the subject of much praise by Dr Morton, a VD specialist of The World Health organisation in Singapore.
     During Exercise ""Bersatu Padu"" when Singapore City was full of servicemen - sometimes as many as ten thousand on recreation - S/Sgt Brown's intimate knowledge of the City and its mood was undoubtedly a major factor in keeping the number of unpleasant incidents which occurred down to a minimum.
     In conclusion, this Senior NCO has made a contribution to the British Army's good name far beyond that which could normally be expected of someone of his rank and service.   He has, personally, been a major factor in the safeguarding of the Army's health and maintenance of its reputation during off-duty hours.

Citation:   A member of the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police for the past seventeen years Staff Sergeant Lodge has a fine record of hard and successful work in the field of criminal investigation but this recommendation concerns the last 27 month during which time he was employed as Quartermaster in the Special Investigation Branch RMP BAOR.
      Because the administrative cell in this unit is very small the quartermaster's responsibilities are considerable, extending beyond provisioning and accounting for MT and stores to administrative backing for special jobs including close security duties with visiting royalty (19 visits in the past two years), and for special teams raised for particularly serious or difficult enquiries, for purchases from three different funds and all travel by unit personnel.   This last task is very important, for investigators frequently have to be moved long distances at short notice.
    Although SIB BAOR is widely deployed to twelve locations in the Federal Republic of Germany, Berlin and Belgium, by hard work and giving up much of his own time staff Sergeant Lodge has improved the efficiency of his unit in these fields to a degree which has drawn favourable comment from numerous inspecting officers, and he has also played a large part in the development of new equipment for the SIB role which is now being taken into use.
     Particularly noteworthy however, in a period when one member of the unit was killed in a riding accident leaving a young family of four and other unit families were his by serious illness of misfortune, is the Christian spirit and hard, successful work which Staff Sergeant Lodge put into alleviating distress and providing practical assistance.   Whilst only the recipients themselves know the full extent of this assistance, the high morale of the unit at the end of a difficult period owes much to his unremitting effort on and off duty.
     Staff Sergeant Lodge leaves BAOR in March 1971 on posting the the United Kingdom.   He completes 23 years service with the colours in September 1975.

Citation:   On 27th June 1970, Lance Corporal Eastham was a member of an unarmed military police patrol ordered to the Ardoyne area of Belfast.   On arrival the patrol found that troops had erected road blocks across which was considerable small arms fire.   The patrol moved forward through the road block with the intention of identifying and, if possible arresting gunmen.
As there was a disorderly crowd in a neighbouring street, Lance Corporal Eastham and his Sergeant walked towards them;  even though bullets fired from side streets were ricochetting off the walls on either side.   As they reached their objective a civilian ran past, stopped and looked around.   At that moment Lance Corporal Eastham heard a humming whistling sound close to his head followed by a loud slap.   The civilian fell to the pavement, wounded.
The section Sergeant obtained assistance and carried the wounded civilian out of the line of fire.   Lance Corporal Eastham went back to seek medical assistance and seeing an Army ambulance coming towards him he signalled the driver to stop, but the vehicle came to a halt in the direct line of fire from another street.   Despite the continuing fire across the road, Lance Corporal Eastham ran to the ambulance to tell the driver to move; but as he opened the door a bullet struck the driver in the jaw.   Lance Corporal Eastham forced the driver down across the seats and gave him a dressing which the driver wound round his jaw.   The driver, however insisted on remaining at the wheel of his vehicle, so Lance Corporal Eastham directed him out of the line of fire.
Although only eighteen and a half years old Lance Corporal Eastham behaved under fire with all the coolness and resolution of a seasoned soldier.   Unarmed and wearing no protective clothing he exposed himself to the greatest danger in order to carry out his duty and help others.",,,
2593,2218,,5,45487,10676,1971-10-05,"Awarded MBE as a WOI .   Citation:  During more than eight months in Northern Ireland, Regimental Sergeant-Major Poole set a splendid example to soldiers, police and civilians alike.   On 27th June 1970, he exposed himself to great danger in a clash between rival factions which resulted in the death of several persons.   Unarmed and unprotected except by a steel helmet, which was dented during the action, he made several arrests and assisted in others.
On 28th September 1970, during serious rioting, he saw a vicious crowd attacking two Royal Marines.   One Marine had been kicked and beaten unconscious; the other had his back to a wall fighting to retain his rifle.   Though he risked being shot if they obtained the rifle, RSM Poole ran alone into the mob, dragged them off the Marine with the rifle and, standing astride the unconscious man, held off the attackers with his pistol until help arrived.   There is no doubt that he saved the men from grave injury.
Throughout the period he exerted a steadying effect wherever he appeared and by his bold and courageous action averted clashes on numerous occasions.

Citation:   During this period Cpl (A/Sgt) Jones has been in charge of an integrated British and commonwealth Military Police detachment responsible for the discipline of the Commonwealth Brigade units stationed in Camp Terendak.
     The Commonwealth Brigade Provost Unit is still in North Malaya and is commanded by a Major.   Pending their arrival an ""ad hoc"" unit has been formed to carry out their task until the move south is complete.   Sgt Jones as NCO i/c this detachment has had to bear the brunt of a difficult situation and frequently deal with tasks which would normally be dealt with by an officer.   he has performed these duties in an outstanding manner.
     Malacca city adjacent to the Cantonment has in the past been unused to large numbers of British/Commonwealth soldiers.   During the period of Sgt Jones command there have been three major units and numerous minor all dependant on Malacca for their recreation.
     The city is a hot bed of gangsters, vice and disease.   Secret Societies flourish; the pitfalls for the unwary soldier are numerous.   Further there is a strong political element which would welcome and incident likely to bring discredit on HM Forces.   Due to the untiring efforts of this NCO good relations have been preserved with the civil population and there have been no major incidents between soldiers and local rowdies.
     Extremely good liaison has been preserved with the Civil Police.   The British Officer Commanding the City Police Force with whom Jones has had to liaise has commended him on numerous occasions and favourable comments have frequently been passed to senior officers of this Headquarter.
     The sudden impact of a large military population has greatly added to the difficulties of Malacca's traffic problem.   This has required considerable research and co-operation between the Civil and Military Police.   The selection and marking of military routes and the implementation of a WD traffic plan has all contributed considerably towards accident prevention.   Sgt Jones has been largely instrumental in achieving this state of affairs.
     To summarise.   During his tour in Malacca this NCP has been solely responsible for the following:-
(a) The maintenance of discipline in the Cantonment and Malacca City.
(b) The prevention of crime and enforcement of 'out of bounds' areas.   The protection of soldiers from local hazards.
(c) Liaison with Civil Police and local civil government departments.
(d) Maintenance of a joint Civil and Military Police traffic plan.
(e) Liaison with the support of the garrison Commander and other commanding officers.   A duty which he has performed with tact and understanding.
     It is considered that the bearing in mind his age and rank the calibre of Sgt Jones performance is such as to warrant recognition, particularly as these duties would normally be carried out by an officer.

Citation:   Lt/Col LEONARD in his appointment as Assistant Provost Marshal has the difficult task of serving a superior officer of a different nationality of the same rank and of directing International police operations and criminal investigation within SHAPE, and directing the physical security for SHAPE installations.
     His job is a most unusual one since the International Police alone are a mixture of some eleven nations (of twenty-two different services) ranging from members of the Royal naval Regulating Branch to the Italian Carabinieri - a force which has not be benefit of operating under an International code of law.
     In performing his duties Lt/Col LEONARD has not only shown the normal tact and understanding expected of an officer of his tank in the RMP but has earned the respect and admiration of his US superior and the highest regard of the Commander of his Division - a US Colonel.
     During a period of some 6 months in 1970 during the illness of the Provost Marshal Lt/Col LEONARD was particularly commended by the Commander of his division who wrote:-  ""Particularly noteworthy has been his superlative execution of the duties of the SHAPE Provost Marshal  which he assumed during the recent extended illness of that officer"".
     Uninformed criticism of the police is normal in any large Headquarters and in this international HQ this naturally prevails - even more so because inevitably some view matters through national eyes only and are unable to see wider issues.   But due to Lt/Col LEONARD's extreme tact and cooperation this has never become a problem.
     He has been solely responsible for organising the big parades at SHAPE, such as for NATO's 25th Birthday, Departure of SACUR, 20th Anniversary of SHAPE, departure of DSACEUR, etc.   With international troops at his disposal and no international guide-lines on ceremonial he has devised ceremonial parades which have been great credit, not only to NATO and SHAPE but to the UK.
     Lt/Col LEONARD has put far more than the expected effort into his job and has done much to enhance the prestige of the British Services here at SHAPE.

Citation:   Captain P R LEE RMP assumed the appointment of Officer-in-charge of a Special Investigation Branch (SIB) Detachment Singapore, on 6 November 1968.   On 4 January 1970, he took control of all SIB investigations in Singapore on the departure of the Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal SIB FARELF a Major whose appointment was dis-established on the assumption that the frequency and seriousness of cases requiring investigation by the SIB would decrease.   In the ensuing eighteen months this has not been the case.
     Events have proved that he has been required to undertake numerous serious and delicate inquiries, the conduct of which has demanded a high degree of professional skill combined with much discretion.   The nature of some of the inquiries was such that they would normally have been undertaken by a much more senior SIB officer had one been available in the theatre.   Capt LEE has shown that he possesses may qualities above those required of his present rand and he has carried out his investigations, may of which were of a most unpleasant nature, with meticulous tack and scrupulous fairness.
     At one time there was considerable concern about allegations in the local press of widespread drug abuse amongst Service school-children in Singapore.   Only by his high standard of supervision of protracted and delicate inquiries by his investigations, was Captain Lee able to supply sufficient facts to enable Commanders to make a balanced appreciation of the situation and initiate remedial action without undue adverse publicity.   In addition, Capt LEE controlled the inquiries into this matter in such a way that a high standard of co-operation was obtained from the children, parents and school teachers concerned;  in doing so he assisted in preparing the way for the subsequent remedial action.   He has also mad a noteworthy contribution to the education in drug prevention of the units in Singapore.
     In addition to his British responsibilities, Captain LEE was tasked with the supervision and training of the Australian and New Zealand SIB Section (SIS) Singapore.   This was necessary because the SIB had been expanded and the range of offences with the investigators were required to deal increased, but no suitable qualified Australian or New Zealand officer was available.   As a result of Captain LEE's sustained efforts during the past eighteen months, together with he leadership and high standard of technical ability, the SIB have achieved a good standard of operational efficiency.

Citation:   Staff Sergeant Brien has now been 18 months at HQ AFCENT. he is the senior RMP representative of the RMP at this headquarters and was placed in charge of a detachment of 22 international policemen operating at the barracks at Tapijn, Maastricht.   The main Provost Branch of HQ AFCENT is based at Hendrik Kamp, Brunssum.   He has, therefore, had to accept a large measure of individual responsibility and control.   He has shown right from the start that he has high qualities of leadership an a good depth of professional knowledge and common sense.   His force of international policemen exudes an air of proficiency, smartness and enthusiasm.   One of the most important aspects of his leadership has bee the manner in which he has been able to weld together an international body of men to act with complete cooperation and friendly coordination.   Brian has achieved these results not merely by his personal qualities but by his complete dedication to his work for which he is prepared to work very long hours and, at times, to the detriment of his domestic circumstances.   Brien spares no pains to continuously advise and guide his men and frequently, travels long distances at night to carry out spot checks and give necessary assistance.
     The Staff Sergeant's efforts and work were even more outstanding during the last exercise WINTEX for which he was initially  much involved in the planning and preparation for police and security requirements at the exercise site and for arrangements for traffic control overall.   Thereafter during the last 2 weeks he set up a control section from which he was rarely absent during night and day.   The fact that the exercise was free  from security incidents and traffic accidents was in a large measure due to the efficient planning and control of Staff Sergeant Brien.
     Tapijn Barracks is a sensitive spot for possible political incidents and because of the presence of highly classified equipment and an armoury.   By their alertness the police were able to counter three intruder attempts over the last 18 months, and there is no doubt that this is due to the excellent organisation set up by Brien who had implemented a new system of guards and patrols.   
     Staff Sergeant Brien has earned the respect of all who have served with him regardless of rank or nationality.   He has made an outstanding contribution to police work at AFCENT and has acted always in the best traditions of the British Army and his own Corps.   His loyalty and exceptional service and devotion to duty render him worthy of the award of the BEM for which he is strongly recommended.

Citation:     In June 1970 it was decided to form a special Military Police Section in Northern Ireland to co-ordinate all prosecutions in which members of the Army were involved.   On arrival in Northern Ireland Corporal Darby-Jones, then a Lance Corporal, was given the task, with two other Junior NCO's, of assessing the practical problems involved and developing a suitable system of operation.
     Corporal Darby-Jones automatically became leader of the group and working immensely long hours he played a major part in solving the complex legal and organisational problems with which the section was faced.   He established excellent working relations with all the authorities involved: legal, police and military, earning their appreciation and un-stinted admiration with his initiative, imagination and superlative tact.   Due to his efforts cases were presented more smoothly and effectively in court, police  and Army relations improved an the confidence and morale of ordinary soldiers given an uplift.
     Since June 1970 he has supervised the accurs to documentation of nearly 1,500 persons arrested by soldiers and arranged the attendance on time of some 2,000 military witnesses at civil court hearings, a complex and demanding task as many of the witnesses were in overseas stations by the time the cases in which they were involved were heard and because the overburdened courts are working to a very tight schedule.   The section became responsible for the investigation and processing of complaints against the Army, the analysis and evaluation of court results and the production of statistics relating to all aspects of their work.   In all these activities Corporal Darby-Jones's influence quickly manifested itself with the resultant efficiency.
     Over the last year the section has made an immense contribution towards the success of peace-keeping operations in Northern Ireland and played a unique part in the maintenance of the Army's morale.   Much of the credit for this must go to Corporal Darby-Jones who has produced a standard of work far above that to be expected of someone of his tank and set an example which has been an inspiration to all.
     Such outstanding conduct deserved recognition.

Citation:   S/Sgt Wood joined RMP at the age of 23 in 1955 having previously served since 1951 in RAMC and RADC in both Middle East Land Forces and East Africa.   Within one year of joining RMP he was granted the rank of acting Sergeant and was posted to Cyprus returning to uk in 1959 where he served until 1962 being mad substantive Sergeant in 1960.   He as then posted to BAOR until 1966, followed by rapid postings in FARELF, serving in Singapore, Borneo and Hong Kong where he was made acting Staff Sergeant.   During this latter tour he received many commendations and appreciations of his investigational abilities,  especially a case in 1967 when by his skill four locally enlisted personnel were convicted of murder.
     S/Sgt Wood took up his present post in November 1968.   Having a busy role Berlin Detachment is especially important policing as it does a large service population and dependents, and, in special cases under the rights of the allied Protective Powers investigates cases involving local civilian.
     Most of the cases investigated by this NCO have been of a difficult and serious nature.   His perseverance, strength of character and logical report writing have been much appreciated by the staff, especially in a recent case involving a vehicle belonging to a sponsored organisation travelling the Helmstedt Berlin Autobahn through East Germany.
     Although on call 24 hours a day his enthusiasm has never flagged and the energy he devotes to the training and welfare of his juniors is reflected in their enthusiasm and high morale.   His tact and close liaison with Public Safety Branch of British Military Government, Berlin KRIPO, Customs authorities, French Gendarmerie, US Military Police and Air Force Police has greatly helped to maintain the good reputation of troops stationed in a thickly populated city.    
     The degree of responsibility he has willingly shouldered during the absence of his OIC, especially considering the sensitive nature of West Berlin, is far beyond that normally expected of a Staff Sergeant.
     The effort he has put into all aspects of his work has been far beyond the call of duty.   His mature sense of judgement and concern for the individual have earned him the fullest trust and respect of the Headquarters and Commanding Officers in the area his detachment serves, and have much enhanced the reputation of the Corps.

Citation.   Although this citation covers the period 15/4/70 to 25/1/1972, I have known this officer over a period of years and have worked closely with him on a previous tour of duty.
     During the period under review he has shown himself to be a first class SIB officer dedicated to his job and of complete integrity.
     During this period as a result of Major Woods diligence the investigation rate has risen by a good 50% and the detection rate has risen accordingly.   The observation rate has risen by as much as 70%.   His unit has a very heavy workload, three hundred and thirty nine cases in 1971, and Major wood has been personally responsible for the investigation of a number of difficult cases including an extremely complicated paymaster fraud which took six months of painstaking investigation, a considerable amount of which was done outside normal working hours.
     He has never spared himself in personally carrying out investigations and supervising the work of his unit.   He has been a tremendous inspiration to his NCO's in this respect.   So much to that they are also prepared to work equally long hours on investigations and observations.
      On his own initiative ha has spent many hours both on and off duty in improving relations with his opposite numbers in the Royal Hong Kong Police resulting in complete trust and first class co-operation in this field.
     He has shown himself particularly keen on crime prevention and has spent a considerable amount of his leisure time lecturing to schools, wives clubs and family groups on this subject.   He is particularly keen on the prevention of the misuse of drug sand has spent much of his normal leisure time in observation work and on lecturing and advising schools and families on this particular subject.   He formed a drug squad within his unit and I am confident that the activities of this squad have helped considerably to keep the misuse of drugs by servicemen and their dependents in Hong Kong to the low level which it is.
     The staff and units are constantly praising the quality of the work done by SIB in the colony and this is as result of the leadership and example shown to the members of SIB by Major Wood.

Citation:   Staff Sergeant Baldwin has been unit MT NCO since January 1970.   During that time he has been totally responsible for the efficient running of the unit transport which now amounts to eighty-seven vehicles.   He has maintained a truly excellent standard in the face of the most daunting difficulties.   Day after day vehicles have been returned to him with every tyre punctured, windscreens smashed body work damaged and all sorts of mechanical defects.   With brilliant organisation and dogged determination ha has overcome all these problems and kept the vehicles on the road.   Without such devoted service and success of RMP operations in Northern Ireland would have been seriously impaired.
     He also supervised and controlled the installation of a wide range of radio equipment in the vehicles, made more difficult by the installation of vehicle armour, with practically no disruption of duties:  a single and valuable achievement.
     In addition to his technical duties, he has also carried out a full share of police duties in Belfast, much of it during some of the worst rioting experienced in Northern Ireland.   Although forced to act, because of his MT, as either commander of an ad hoc platoon of administrative personnel or relief platoon commander, he set a splendid example to resolution, courage and professional ability which was an inspiration to all.
     To have carried out duties which would be the most responsibility of a technical quartermaster in most units is a splendid enough achievement, but for over two years Staff Sergeant Baldwin also played a full part in military police operations in Belfast.
   His outstanding conduct and contribution to the success of operations over such a long period is worthy of high recognition.

Citation:  S/Sgt Hill joined the Corps of Royal Military Police in 1958 at the age of 20, having previously served for two years in the Intelligence Corps.   In 1959 he was selected for SIB duties and from the outset took every available opportunity in his own time to increase his knowledge in the field of scientific aids to crime detection particularly in the identification of forged documents and police photography.   As a result his is now a member of the British Academy of Forensic Sciences and the Royal Photographic Society.
     In 1964 he attended the Metropolitan Police Scenes of Crime Course where his outstanding ability drew extremely favourable comment.   He then served for 3 years in Cyprus where his expert services were frequently in demand after normal duty hours by the Cyprus and SBA Police Forces.
     S/Sgt Hill commenced his present tour in BAOR in Dec 68 and again his expertise has been such sought after particularly in gathering of forensic evidence and latterly in connection with all aspects of drug abuse and finger print identification.   He has been on call 24 hours a day and his enthusiasm has not flagged for one moment;  his sole aim in life is to be of service.   In 1970 he received an outstandingly good report following a finger-print course at New Scotland yard.
     He has organised and perfected measures taken by SIB to combat the sudden increase in drug offences involving not only soldiers but their dependants in BAOR.   He suet up a close working ling with both the German and US CID narcotic investigators and has ensured a constant flow of information relating to the sources of drugs and their manner of distribution.
     With typical foresight and unbounding energy he produced - practically thew whole of it in his own time - a fully automatic tape and slide colour presentation designed especially to suit the needs of the junior officer and NCO who may be brought into contact with the problem of drug abuse amongst teenagers.   This has been highly commended by the British Forces Education Service and is now being shown to teaching staffs and parents throughout BAOR.
     S/Sgt Hill has made an outstanding contribution to the measures taken in BAOR to contain the problem of drug abuse in the Army.   His efforts have been far beyond the call of duty and have much enhanced not only the reputation of his Corps, but the Army as a whole.

Citation:   Following service in the Seaforth Highlanders, Staff Sergeant Rose joined the Corps of Royal Military Police and for the past ten years has been employed with the Special Investigation Branch, during which time he has built up fine record of hard and successful work in the field of criminal investigation.   This recommendation concerns the last eighteen months during which time he has been in charge of the SIB Detachment at Hounslow.
     The workload of that particular Detachment has increased considerably since 1969 and although it has not been possible to increase the manpower. Staff Sergeant Rose has continued to deal with the added commitment, which included may cases of a serious and difficult nature.   This effort has absorbed much of his off-duty time and whilst on call for twenty four hours a day, his enthusiasm has never flagged and the energy devoted to his work is reflected in the high standard of results achieved.   His tact and close liaison with the civil police, other law enforcement agencies an local authorities has been a major contributory factor in the successful completion of so man investigations.
     In October this year, he was responsible for the investigation of a particularly complicated murder that had occurred in 1965, being personally involved with enquiries in the United Kingdom and Singapore as well as having to make arrangements for further inquiries in Hong Kong and Germany.   Due to personal effort, devotion to duty and hard work, the case was brought to a satisfactory conclusion thus confirming the outstanding ability of this NCO.
     Staff Sergeant Rose is due to discharge from the Army in August 1972 on completion of 22 years service.

Citation:   For the past two and a half years Sergeant CAMPBELL has been the sole specialist investigator of drug abuse in the Munster Detachment of the Special Investigation Branch which has responsibility for OSNABRUCK as well as MUNSTER;  each amongst the largest Garrisons in BAOR.
     MUNSTER particularly, with a student population of 23,000 and situated as it is very close to the drug distribution centres in HOLLAND, is a high risk drug area for the British Garrison and abundant evidence is available to show that all types of drugs are readily available in a very large number of places to anyone who wishes to buy them.
     It is to Sergeant CAMPBELL's credit that in these unpromising circumstances the incidence of drug abuse amongst the British Garrison has been minimal and that those few who have made use of drugs have been very quickly caught and very often their German suppliers with them.   The local German police, who knew very little about drugs until Sergeant CAMPBELL instructed them, freely admit their gratitude for his assistance and their initial dependence on his knowledge.   his liaison with them continues to be excellent.
     it is, however, in the field of prevention that Sergeant CAMPBELL has probably achieved most.   In addition to the long hours of his physically taxing job he has devoted much of what would otherwise be off-duty time to lecturing to officers, warrant and non-commissioned officers, families and secondary school children on the angers of drug abuse and the methods of detection an prevention.   His reputation as a lecturer has spread far beyond the Garrisons of MUNSTER and OSNABRUCK and the good which his human, amusing and highly professional talks have done must be incalculable.
   For his unceasing energy, unremitting hard work and considerable skill and enthusiasm in projecting a subject which many do not wish to know about Sergeant CAMPBELL's is richly deserving of an award for which he is now recommended.

Citation:  As DAPM (SIB) Eastern Area BAOR, an appointment he assumed on 3 Jan 1971 he has been responsible for the direction of SIB  enquiries into serious crime committed by military personnel in the 1st British Corps area.   He has personally and most successfully taken charge of an involved case of murder, as well as one of manslaughter and other serious crimes.
     The demands of Northern Ireland for additional SIB investigators has brought about a shortfall in the number normally available within his area of responsibility.   He has ensured that there has been no loss in efficiency or lowering of professional standards, by his own example and careful deployment of available manpower.   In order to maintain this satisfactory position Major Caird has not spared himself and always uncomplainingly placed his duty before his private life and commitments.
     He has taken a deep personal interest in the professional efficiency of inexperienced NCOs and has spent much of his own time helping them with their reports.
     He spearheaded the introduction of training aids in the form of slide, tape presentations in an effort to abate the ever increasing drug problem an devoted a great deal of his won time in assisting units and service schools on the problem of drug abuse.   He has organised many performances of the SIB BAOR drug presentations to Garrison, units, wives clubs and schools in his area.
     During the period Mar - Oct 72, at a time of terrorist activity in Germany, he was the officer personally responsible for the close security protection afforded to seven visiting VIPs including four members of the Royal Family and the Prime Minister.
     Throughout the period of his present appointment, Major Caird has shown a complete disregard for his own interests, and has unselfishly put into all aspects of his work an amount of zeal and effort far beyond the normal call of duty.   He has willingly accepted responsibilities far in excess of that normally expected of an Acting Major.   He has set a tremendous example to his officers, WOs, NCOs, and has earned the admiration and respect of various staff officers which has reflected great credit not only on himself but his unit and Corps.

Citation:   Capt Upton has been responsible for supervising the investigation of all crime committed by or against members and dependents of the ANZUK Force in Singapore and West Malaysia since 1971.   His exceptional powers of leadership have created a highly efficient unit from representatives of all three Services of the three ANZUK nations.
     In the execution of his work within the unit Captain Upton has been personally responsible for satisfactory concluding enquiries into a serious fraud within a major unit of the Force;  this investigation required many months of careful and painstaking examination of many accounts and lengthy interviews with Service and civilian personnel both in Singapore and the United Kingdom.
     He has also been responsible for identifying and eradicating a serious outbreak of drug abuse amongst members of the ANZUK Force and dependents, without publicity in Singapore or in the home countries.   This enquiry, involving long and irregular hours of work, incurred threats of violence to him as it progressed.   Undeterred, he was ultimately successful, and his investigations let to the arrest of 36 Singaporean drug traffickers and the seizure of large quantities of drugs including heroin.   The manner in which this enquiry was handled is worthy of the highest praise inasmuch as it could well have brought serious discredit to the Australian, New Zealand and British Forces stationed in Singapore together with embarrassment to their High Commissions had it become public knowledge.   his extremely close and harmonious relations with the Singaporean and Malaysian authorities enable the ANZUK Commanders to take disciplinary action against their nationals without them appearing before civil courts.
     The two enquiries outlined above represent but a fraction of those undertaken by Captain Upton during his tour.   He has displayed quite outstanding qualities of leadership, technical knowledge, tact and discretion in his dealings with the three ANZUK national contingents and the Singaporean authorities.
     The very good relationships existing at the lower levels of contact between the five nations are due in very large measure to Captain Upton's efforts which have enabled matters of jurisdiction to be resolved with the minimum of fuss and publicity.

On 21st July he displayed great personal bravery and calmness during an extremely dangerous phase of the operation.   Early that morning, on his own initiative, he made a personal reconnaissance of the area scheduled for evacuation and discovered that it was the scene of a fierce fire fight.   Later, after armoured personnel carriers had been called forward to evacuate the people living in the area, Nicholson alloted himself the role of guide.   To carry out this task he rode in the lead Saracen with the top half of his body completely exposed so as to be able to guide the driver.   In all he made three runs into the area ferrying out families.   The last two of these runs were made in the face of uninterrupted cross fire, but at no time did Nicholson move from his exposed position.   On arrival at the houses to be evacuated he moved about calmly in full view of both opposing sides comforting, directing and assisting the families into the Saracens.
There is no doubt that his personal bravery and coolness were the prime reasons which enabled the operation to be carried out with only one casualty.",,,

Citation:     After attempting for five days to reach Allied lines, Lieut. RENDELL was captured near TUNIS on 4 Dec 42 and was imprisoned at CHIETI (Camp 21).   Whilst in transit at CAPUA in Dec 42, he tried to walk out of camp wearing a combination of civilian and Italian clothes, but was turned back at the gate.
     Because of the order given by the senior British Officer, he did not try to leave CHIETI after the Armistice, but was transferred to SULMONA.   With the assistance of another officer he succeeded in hiding in a ration truck and thus escaped.   When he had taken refuge with friendly Italians in SULMON|A for a few days, he realised that there were many P/W hiding in the vicinity.   As Senior Officer he enlisted the help of other officers and formed an organisation for the benefit of all escapers and, before the organisation was broken up by German activity early in Dec 43, over 200 P/W were being cared for.    After reaching ROME Lieut. RENDELL was employed in a minor capacity by the larger organisation and in spite of may alarms remained free until the Allies arrived at the beginning of Jun 44.

Citation:   Major (QM) P E Barton has served in the Royal Military Police for the last thirty years and has held a Quartermaster Commission since August 1964.   On 11th April 1974 he was appointed Regimental Quartermaster of 1st Regiment Royal Military Police a task which included full responsibility for 2nd Regiment RMP - two major units.   The deployment of both Regiments in Northern Ireland covers eight separate locations province wide including three in Belfast.   At Regimental Headquarters at Aldergrove he has had the further responsibility for the housing and feeding of an Armoured Squadron an Army Air Corps Squadron and a Beaver flight quartered in the Camp on roulement tours.   This huge task undertaken with tireless enthusiasm and in the most outstandingly professional way has been reflected in the exceptionally high results of all ancillary Inspections in the period.   His arrival in Ireland coincided with the Ulster Workers Strike and his first task was to take over some semi derelict accommodation and make it habitable for transitees.   He then had to feed, cloth and accommodate some one hundred an twenty reinforcements of the Royal Engineer and the Royal Navy;   These additional personnel brought the Barrack feeding strength to over nine hundred.   He was undaunted by the problems and his outstanding efforts in an incredibly short space of time enabled both Regiments to work effectively throughout the Province at a very tense period.   At the same time he was faced with a
huge problem of maintaining essential services in Alexander Barracks which was subjected to water rationing, electricity cuts, absence of civil labour, emergency cooking arrangements and a shortage of petrol.   The remarkable initiative and tireless work of Major Barton ensured that two major and three minor units were able to operate in some degree of comfort.   The Strike over he as once got down to the enormous problems concerned with converting a new camp designed for an Infantry Battalion to use by five units.   This has entailed constant liaison with DOE and many many long hours of paperwork at night and at weekends which is only now easing up.   It has included the building of Garages, 3 x Squash Courts, a Cine Target Range, Landscaping of the entire Camp, redecoration and re-construction of several building and a host of lesser works services.   The Messing which he runs so carefully for the five units covers seven locations and its exceptionally high confines of his own Department and he is to be seen about the Barracks at all times of the day and night.   His presence and approachability have greatly increased efficiency and maintained high morale.   He is irrepressibly but unfailingly cheerful yet very modes.   His advice is invariably sound.   He is a quite outstanding Regimental Officer and All Ranks hold him in the highest esteem.   This two year tour has proved to be the crowning achievement in his long and distinguished career.   He has set a truly magnificent example with his mastery efficiency, proverbial energy and unfailing helpfulness.   This quite exceptional record has made a resounding contribution to the success of Royal Military Police operations in Northern Ireland and his dedication to the Regiment, his Queen and Country is considered conspicuously worthy of official recognition.

Citation:   14 Det SIB has always been commanded by a commissioned officer, but for nearly two years not WO I Middleton-Jones has commanded it with exceptional dedication and flair.   As part of the Allied occupation forces in Berlin, British servicemen and their families are not subject to the jurisdiction of the West Berlin civil courts, nor do the West Berlin Police investigate any cases involving British subjects.   This is done entirely by the RMP and by 14 Det SIB.   Although undermanned, 14 Det SIB has had quite remarkable success in their skillful investigation of crimes, accidents and deaths.   Much of this success is due to WO I Middleton-Jones's extremely hard work over a very long period, for his talented control of his small team, and by much skillful and patient inquiry.
     Commanding Officers of the many units in this large Garrison are full of praise for Mr Middleton-Jones's helpful and understanding approach and methods.   The efficient handling of 300 cases over the last 18 months is full proof of the enormous work load involved.   Of these 51 were of a very serious nature and ranged from murder, suicide, arson, drug offences, rape, robbery, loss of arms, fraud, wounding to accidental deaths, to mention only a few.   The variety of the cases was enormous, and the problems of investigating them and giving advice required a dedicated and able man.   We were fortunate to have WO I Middleton-Jones who conducted every investigation with commendable skill, thoughtfulness for those involved and yet with dedicated single mindedness.   Few senior NCO's have worked harder, yet with such considerable success as he.   In addition he has established himself as a very fine warrant officer who still finds time to play a full part in Brigade and Garrison Affairs.
     For his skill, hard work, but in particular for his many successes WO I Middleton-Jones deserves very special recognition.

Citation:   During the period under review Major Theis has been employed as the DAPM/OC SIB RMP in this theatre.   As such he has been initially responsible for the investigations into all serious crime and incidents involving the three services in the Colony.   to assist him in his task he has under command a small detachment of ten SIB NCOs.   Under his command and direction his detachment has produced excellent results working long hours and at times travelling many miles to various countries to conduct enquiries.   Their is no doubt that the positive results obtained have been very largely die to Major Theis's drive, determination to see the job through and his own example.   He has personally dealt with many of the more serious and complicated incidents and criminal cases.   These have included murder enquiries, sudden deaths and lengthy complicated cases involving funds.   The careful and painstaking attention to detail which he applies has brought a consistent accuracy to his work.   This in turn has resulted in his enjoying the complete confidence of the Headquarters Staff and units with whom he has had to deal.   The achievement of this very high standard of work has meant long hours of toil often covering all hours of the day and night and all days of the week.
     He and members of his detachment have been particularly active in successful in containing servicemen's involvement with dangerous drugs.   This has called for many hours of observations and enquiries.   The value of this work has been shown by the existing effective control of the situation and the full cooperation of units.   In this respect Major Theis plays a key part in dangerous drugs education and presentations which are given frequently to members and wives of all three service.   in the past fifteen months he has organised and delivered thirty five such presentations to the general benefit of servicemen  and families.   The nature of his work entails a great deal of liaison with the various branches of the civilian police force.   In this field his performance has been excellent and he has gone out of his way to make the liaison a successful one.   He is highly regarded by his civilian police counterparts and this has led to ideal mutual cooperation and assistance.   His total dedication to duty, his untiring diligence and determination have been an inspiration and example not only to the members of his detachment but to all those with whom he has had dealings.

During this time Warrant Officer House accepted the additional responsibility willingly, and frequently had to advise others and make important decisions.   Not only did he display unflagging zeal and energy but his outstanding example was an inspiration to others.   his ability to deal confidently and expertly with all ranks enabled the branch to continue to function efficiently.   He carried out work normally undertaken by a Grade I Staff Officer in addition to his own with complete satisfaction, often under considerable pressure, thus highlighting the outstanding calibre of this Warrant Officer.   Almost single handed he has planned and coordinated the police support for this years British Army Equipment Exhibition and the Army Show.
     His ability to provide definitive information and sound advice has been widely acknowledged by formation staffs, civil police, and other units.   Warrant Officer House by his unremitting application has always placed the interest of the service before his own, and has most worthily upheld the standards of his Corps.

Citation:   Acting Major Smyth assumed the appointment of SO 2 at HQ PM (A) in February 1975 with responsibility for SD and Materiel.   Since then, Army restructuring, the reorganisation of RMP in Northern Ireland and the intensity of military police operations world wide has thrown an exceedingly heavy burden upon his department, most of which he has borne personally.
     Despite the immense pressure and the need for very careful and detailed work he has cheerfully laboured for long and gruelling hours without complaint and without even the slightest deterioration of his standards of work.   His health began to suffer under the strain and he became very run-down resulting in stern advice from the medical officers for him to take a rest.
     Ignoring the doctor's advice Acting Major Smyth brilliantly and successfully accomplished the huge task of producing the establishments, equipment tables and mass of attendant documentation required for the restructuring of RMP under the Army Restructuring Plan.   It is mainly due to his efforts that all aspects of restructuring and re-equipping the Corps were smoothly resolved without inhibiting RMP operations in Northern Ireland or elsewhere.
     During the implementation of restructuring a major reorganisation fo RMP in Northern Ireland was launched entailing a phased reduction of 2nd Regiment RMP leading to its amalgamation in April 1978 and the absorbtion of its remaining companies by 1st Regiment RMP from Aldergrove to Lisburn.   Major Smyth visited HQ Northern Ireland on numerous occasions to advise on the arrangements and played a major part in preparing the new establishment.   It is testimony to his skill, perseverance and sheer hard work that the reorganisation was effected with great smoothness and with no organisational repercussions.
     Throughout his tour of duty whether dealing with manpower, materiel or financial matters, Major Smyth has displayed remarkable skill, determination and dedication of a truly exceptional nature.   He has ignored the daunting and debilitating pressures upon him and maintained a standard of service to the Corps which has engendered great confidence and trust.
     Managing his department with inspired skill and understanding, he has established excellent relations throughout the Ministry of Defence and those civilian organisations with which he had dealings.   Although only an acting major he has made a contribution towards the efficiency of the Corps.

Citation:   Since October 1976 Staff Sergeant (local WO2) Manton has been the only member of the Corps of Royal Military Police on the permanent staff of the British Army Training Unit, Suffield.   During the training season he is supported by a small monthly changing, staff of one sergeant and four corporals.   From November to April each year he has had to work without assistance.
     Throughout his tour of duty and particularly in his last six months here, he has worked very long hours to maintain a very accurate assessment of all that goes on in this community of nearly two hundred families and transient population of up to eleven hundred.   He has worked up and continued an extremely efficient and friendly liaison with all the local provincial and federal police agencies and with some in the United States.   Through hard work, extreme devotion to duty and a proper application of his mature intelligence, sympathetic manner and full participation in all aspect of community life he has gained the confidence and respect of all sections of the community and in this way policed most effectively, usually by prevention and timely advice in the very best traditions of the ""village bobby"".   As a result of his efforts joint patrols have been run with Medicine Hat City Police and Royal Military Police members working side by side, and this has led to Royal Military Police Non Commissioned Officers making arrests of Canadian civilian criminals.
     By his hard work and selfless commitment to leadership by example Staff Sergeant Manton has maintained and enhanced the good name of the British Army in Western Canada and is most deserving of recognition for his achievement.   His performance has been far beyond that expected from a man of his rank and experience.

Citation:     In addition to his normal duties, Corporal Robinson has been employed as the Unit and Garrison Road Safety Officer.   He has devoted to this task time and effort far exceeding that expected of him.
     On his own initiative he has undertaken the organisaiton of road safety training schemes for the child population of BAOR's largest Garrison, Osnabruck.   not only have these schemes been of enormous safety value to the children but also they have fostered a relationship between the children and 'the law' which will be of lasting benefit.   He has continually sought to ensure that his training is inventive and therefore interesting and entertaining to the children.   Through his thoroughness, care and preparation he has become one of Osnabruck's schools' most sought after visitor.
     As a member of the Garrison's Road Safety Committee he has advised on legal aspects, road safety precautions and education, schools liaison visits and cycle proficiency training.

Citation:  WO2 Ferrier has been the Royal Military Police Special Investigation Branch representative in Belize since February 1985.   His responsibilities include the conduct of all criminal investigations involving members of the Royal Navy and Army and the gathering of criminal intelligence.
     His criminal investigations have covered the full range of crimes including death, rape, weapon losses and burglaries.   His work has always been meticulous both in the unbiased approach an technical detail.  His dogged pursuit of truth and accuracy have earned him the praise of coroners, civil courts and Court Martial.   His professional approach to complex problems has earned him the unstinting admiration of the Belize Police Force who now regularly seek his advice and assistance to train their own investigators.   This is no mean credit in a newly independant country, where local people have been shown to be only too reluctant to seek advice from British officials.
   His development of contacts throughout the civil community is legendary and is widely respected.  The accuracy of his information and diligence of his investigation has permitted the Unite States Drug Enforcement Agency to conduct successful prosecutions against a dangerous American drug smuggling ring.   Moreover his knowledge of the local criminal community has resulted in a steady and significant decrease in crimes against the Services.
     WO2 Ferrier, had conducted more investigations with a higher rate of successful prosecutions than any of his predecessors;  his name has become a byword for law and order in Belize   The unremitting pressure under which he has worked has been acknowledged by the addition of a second investigator.

Citation:  The Royal Commission of Criminal Procedures' recommendations to replace the Judges Rules by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) on 1st January 1986 impacted on the entire range of police procedures from the treatment and questioning of suspects to the detention of offenders.   The implications and effects were fundamental and far reaching.   As SO 1 Police Legal in Headquarters Provost Marshal (Army), Lieutenant Colonel Hewlett-Smith was responsible for introducing PACE to the Royal Military Police.
     Early in 1985, acting entirely on his own initiative, he anticipated accurately the likely effects of PACE on Service police procedures.   By force of personality and because of the high professional esteem in which he is held by his civilian and military colleagues, he persuaded the Royal Naval Provost, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force Police Staffs to join him in setting up a Tri-Service Police Co-ordination Committee which he chaired.   Its original terms of reference were confined to assuming the implications and effects of PACE in detail and to agreeing the Tri-Service Police procedures required to facilitate its introduction.   Under his guidance, the Committee completed their complex negotiations and drafting in good time, he then set up a comprehensive indoctrination system for Provost around the World to enable them to implement PACE on 1st January 1986;  meeting all legal obligations, with full understanding and without detriment to the levels of support which they provided.
     However he did not stop there.   He decided, again entirely on his own initiative that the Police Co-ordination Committee offered a means of enhancing Services 
Police Forces operational and cost effectiveness whilst simultaneously reducing their resource consumption.   Accordingly he drafted and obtained agreement to revised terms of reference aimed at the co-ordination of introduction of further new legislation, the exploitation, identification and development of Tri-Services police procedures and practices and the co-ordination of Service police training.   Already there have been significant benefits obtained as a result with the introduction of a new Services police procedures, given urinalysis equipment for the fight against drugs, and stop and search powers.   These procedures which he has initiated are shortly to be activated.   This is only the beginning of what promises to be the most fundamental change in the Services approach to policing.
     Lieutenant Colonel Hewlett-Smith has acted throughout in the highest traditions of the Police Service, on his own initiative, often outside the specification of his appointment and with outstanding determination, dedication and professionalism.   He has brought about developments which have enhanced the Service Police Forces' efficiently and which will undoubtedly bring many more benefits to
the Service Police
and make importantly, to the service community whom they serve as it develops.   His achievements far exceed his official brief and are most worthy of official recognition.

Citation:   Lieutenant Colonel Manning enlisted into the Royal Military Police in 1952 and has served in West Germany, the Middle East and on three operational tours in Northern Ireland.   In Cyprus in 1954 he was Mentioned in Dispatches for distinguished action when ambushed on patrol and in 1970 was awarded the General Officer Commanding's commendation when Company Sergeant Major of the first resident Royal Military Police unit to be stationed in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.   He was commissioned in 1974 and in 1976 was granted a quartermaster commission.   Soon afterwards he was posted for the second time to Ulster where he served with distinction as Quartermaster during the amalgamation of 1st and 2nd Regiment Royal Military Police.   On promotion to Lieutenant Colonel in 1984 he became the first directly enlisted soldier in the Royal Military Police to attain this rank.
     In 1984 Lieutenant Colonel Manning was posted to the Royal Military Police Training Centre.   Faced with a wide variety of duties and plethora of extramural tasks he accepted each challenge with outstanding zeal and patience but above all an indomitable determination to ensure the best service that resources and his considerable expertise could provide.   A cheerful and thoroughly dedicated officer he continually sought ways to improve the facilities.   By his perception and administrative acumen he established the Training Centre as one of the best equipped and superbly maintained in the Army.   it is a barracks of which the Corps is justly proud.
     Nearing the end of his service after 34 years in the Corps of Royal Military Police he still maintains a keen interest in all facets of Corps activities.   As Chapel Warden he instigated the installation of three stained-glass windows.   As Co-ordinator of the Chichester International Marches he organised the support for 7000 civilian and military participants - a herculean effort and an unmitigated success.   The benefit of this event to community relations and international goodwill has enabled the Royal Military Police and the Army to enjoy the highest esteem and reputation.   Although fully employed with his military duties he found time to maintain two welfare chalets belonging to the Central Benevolent Fund.   Each summer he ensured these holiday homes were suitably equipped to receive old and infirm ex-servicemen and their dependants.   Their well-being and comfort is his foremost consideration.
     Lieutenant Colonel Manning's undaunted enthusiasm and equanimity have always ensured the needs of the service receive first priority.   His exceptional example to others, wise counsel and outstanding service make him a most respected Cor personality.   his compelling qualities of leadership, professionalism and selfless dedication and devotion to duty have been a remarkable example and inspiration to all members of the Corps of Royal Military Police and are most worthy of official recognition.

     On 24 January members of the Royal Military Police Close Protection Team, led by Staff Sergeant Laffan, who were on duty protecting British personnel, came under fire from looting soldiers who had just murdered a civilian in a nearby house.   The Team promptly engaged and drove off those responsible.   at 10.45 hours on 25 January five soldiers broke into and fired shots inside the house next to that occupied by the Deputy High commission and five other High Commission staff.   One of the Team was on guard.   These five soldiers, intent on looting, then attempted to enter the Deputy High Commissioner's house, opening fire with at least one automatic weapon.   The RMP Team member returned fire and held them off.   The soldiers, unable to close, then engaged the Deputy High Commissioners house with rocket propelled grenades as well as with automatic weapons.   The Deputy High Commissioner reported by radio to the High Commissioner and to the Quick Reaction Squad of four men, again led by Staff Sergeant Laffan, who were on standby 1 1/1 kilometres away.   Staff Sergeant Laffan immediately sought the obtained the High Commissioner's authority to attempt a rescue.   Under his direction the Quad promptly drove to the Deputy High Commissioner's house coming under heavy small arms and rocket fire as they arrived.   Staff Sergeant Laffan immediately dismounted two of his team to cover the front gate and led his other team member in a left flanking attack to secure higher ground, killing, as they moved forward, one of those attacking the Deputy High Commissioner's house.   With almost no ammunition left, but having achieved a lull, Staff Sergeant Laffan then coordinated the withdrawal by vehicle of all the staff under a combination of small arms fire and smoke, leaving two members of his team to secure this move.   Immediately after seeing the High Commission staff to safety he then returned to the scene of the fighting to withdraw the other members of the team.
     Like the remainder of his team Staff Sergeant Laffan knew in advance that a rescue would be hazardous, especially as confused fighting was nearing the area.   Staff Sergeant Laffan unhesitatingly risked his own life in the performance of his duty, exposing himself to fire frequently to secure the area.   he achieved the rescue against superior numbers and despite being engaged by rocket and rifle fire throughout the incident.   Staff Sergeant Laffan, who was responsible for bringing his Team to a high state of efficiency, led from the font throughout the action.  His personal example, tactical skill and calm direction of the squad while under fire was largely responsible for saving British citizens from death or injury and is in the highest traditions of the Army.

Citation:  For his courage, devotion to duty and military skills in responding to a serious threat to lives of civilians in Kampala in January 1986.
Citation:     There was fierce fighting in Kampala between 23 - 26 January 1986 when 2,500 National Resistance Army troops defeated more numerous forces defending the city, and installed a new Government.
     On 24 January members of the Royal Military Police Protection Team were shot at by looting soldiers who had just murdered a civilian in a nearby house.   At 10.45 hrs on 25 January 5 soldiers broke into and fired shots within a house next to that occupied by the Deputy High Commissioner. and 5 other High Commission staff where Corporal Gerrard was on guard.   5 soldiers then attempted to enter the Deputy High Commissioner's house.   One opened fire with an automatic weapon.   Corporal Gerrard returned fire.   The soldiers then attacked the deputy High Commissioner's house with Rocket Propelled Grenades as well as automatic weapons.   Corporal Gerrard stood this attack off while the Deputy High Commissioner reported by radio to the High Commissioner and to the Quick Reaction Squad (Staff Sergeant Laffan, Corporal Jones, Corporal Wood and Corporal Moore) on standby at a house 1 1/2 kilometres away.   Staff Sergeant Laffan immediately sought and obtained the High Commissioner's authority to attempt a rescue.   The Squad promptly drove to the Deputy High Commissioner's house coming under heavy small arms fire, and dispersed their attackers killing one.   other soldiers then fired on the Squad for an adjoining garden.   The Squad silenced this fire.   The Squad then entered the Deputy High Commissioner's garden again coming under fire from a different quarter, and silenced this opposition after a 10 minute fire fight.   The Squad then evacuated all inside the house to relative safety under cover of smoke.   In the rescue, which lasted 30 minutes, Corporal Gerrard and the Quick Reaction squad expended 550 rounds, preventing at least two opposing Rocket Propelled Grenade teams for scoring hits on the Deputy High Commissioner's house or the vehicles used in the rescue.
     All involved knew in advance that a rescue would be hazardous, especially since confused fighting between the opposing armies was nearing the area.   The unhesitating courage, devotion to duty and skill of all the Royal Military Policemen engaged in carrying out this rescue saved those under attack from death or injury.
     Corporal Gerrard's prompt reaction to the attack upon those he was guarding, and his readiness alone and unsupported to expose himself to fire to prevent the attackers from approaching closer or scoring hits with their Rocket Propelled Grenades kept his charges safe until the Quick Reaction Squad arrived, and it is a credit to his Service.

Citation:  Lieutenant Colonel Thomas assumed the appointment of Commander Royal Military Police, Headquarters 1st British Corps on 14th June 1976 and held the post for some 2 1/2 years.   During that time he was heavily involved in the Royal Military Police aspects of the Spearpoint series of Exercises, the Jubilee Review and the complete reorganisation of Provost throughout the Corps area.   Each of these was daunting enough in itself but when combined amounted to an unusual and startling burden.   None the less they were all accomplished in the most splendid fashion and with an efficiency which not only proved to be of great benefit to 1st British Corps but also reflected tremendous credit on the Royal Military Police.
     On arrival in post, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas was confronted with enormous problems concerned with traffic control and movement of a large number of Armoured and Mechanised Units over widely dispersed areas so as to meet the needs of the extensive and far reaching Spearpoint Exercises.   This involved not only a very high degree of planning and co-ordination but also the ability to work for long, sustained periods - often in liaison with the German Police.   there is no doubt that Lieutenant Colonel Thomas' superb efforts over this long period of time were a significant factor making for the success of these important manoeuvres on which so much depended for the future organisation of the Corps.
     The start of 1977, however, brought additional demands on this officer when he was appointed to the Jubilee Planning Committee.   For the first 6 months of that year he was involved in the movement planning for this unique event and, then, in early July he was entirely responsible for the execution of  the traffic control plans and the high degree of protection for a wide variety of visitors.   The fact that they worked so magnificently was a tribute to his splendid, untiring efforts and to his careful organisation which involved his entire Provost resources over some hundreds of square miles.
     Simultaneously, the Army restructuring plan necessitated the reorganisation of the entire Provost support, involving many small and scattered units in 1st British Corps.   Despite the extremely heavy commitments described above, despite manpower shortages which caused constant management crises and despite the pressures of routine police work he undertook this new and heavy commitment with characteristic zeal.   After many months of hard unremitting toil and protracted negotiations this reorganisation was successfully completed so that the reduced resources of the Royal Military Police are now used to optimum effect.
     Throughout this period when he was working under punishing pressure Lieutenant Colonel Thomas proved to be imaginative in planning and infallible in organisation whilst pursuing his single minded course of upholding his Corps' great reputation with unflinching steadiness and consistent success.   By any measure the load placed on him has been immense and has called for very long hours of dedicated work;  yet he has been indefatigable in his efforts on behalf of 1st British Corps and has been unswerving in his maintenance of the highest possible standards.   his efforts have been wholly admirable;  and he has shown by example and personality how sheer service  itself can be the greatest of military virtues and how devotion to duty can in being untarnished by selfish motives, bring its own fines reward in being a great benefit to others.

Citation:   Brigadier Matthews has been Provost Marshal for the past three years and these years have been busy enough by any standard.   He has been responsible for the centenary celebrations and for the reception and parade for Her Majesty in her first year as the Colonel in Chief of the Royal Military Police.   Both these affairs were magnificently carried out and brought great praise from both military and civilian audiences.
     He has personally enhanced civil relationships with the County fo Sussex where the Training Centre is, by introducing Marches to which not only people from all over the United Kingdom attend, but also from all over Europe.   These have now become an annual event.
     He has made significant advances to the Traditions of the Corps by introducing many, many new achievements which officers and NCO's have found pleasure and reward in obtaining.   he has enhanced the training by his imaginative ideas such as by the building of a horse statue, the first full sized horse and RMP NCO rider sculptured in the past twenty five years, and by a life sized RMP soldier; and by enlarging considerably the Old Comrades Association
     His relationship with the Civil Police is outstanding.   His knowledge of his officers and NCO's is profound and deep.   His standards and those he expects of others can be summed up in one word - excellent.

Citation:   Sergeant Sheridan assumed his appointment in November 1977 as headquarters 3rd Armoured Division arrived in BAOR.   he worked tirelessly during the succeeding year to establish a first class office system for his Branch.   He has set u a library of Police Reports, with a detailed indexing system which allows for easy and speedy retrieval;  a system which is of great assistance to 'A' Branch as well.   This is now a model for all Provost Branches and had been produced out of officer hours.
     On top of his normal very full workload, Sergeant Sheridan's experience has been sought on all road movement planning in support of training for the Division.   Such exercises have been numerous during the past 28 months.   Sergeant Sheridan has given his time willingly and generously to this task, producing accurate and detailed plans which would normally be carried out the a Staff Officer.
     Sergeant Sheridan' has a deep interest in shooting and has voluntarily assisted with a number of Skill at Arms meeting.   His organisation of the recording team at the Divisional meeting was of a very high order.   He produced faultless scores and results lists in a very guick time.
     In summary, Sergeant Sheridan's interest in the well-being of the Army community is unquestioned and his leisure time is almost wholly taken u assisting in numerous youth activities.
     In summary, Sergeant Sheridan produces outstanding results in all fields of activity in which he becomes involved.   Sadly, a break in service in the past has limited his promotion prospects.   Knowing this, he still continues to provide the very highest lever of service of which hi is capable for the benefit of the service.
     It is considered the his contribution to the Service richly deserves recognition by an appropriate award.

Citation:     This Non-Commissioned Officer has made a dramatic and outstanding contribution towards Road Safety since his appointment as Unit Road Safety Officer in November 1978.
     he very quickly realised the urgent need to increase road safety instruction throughout all British Forces Education Service Schools in the Colony, to reduce the lever of accidents and prevent possible loss of life.   Operating through Headmasters, he established an excellent rapport with teaching staff at all levels, and has run a highly imaginative and constructive road safety campaign.   His efforts have won the acclaim of teachers and parents, plus enthusiastic response from children of all ages.
     In parallel with these efforts, Sergeant Vockins has been the instigator and driving force of two thriving Road Safety youth Clubs for service children.   The first of these is the ""Big W"", a skate board club designed for children age between five and fifteen.   Meeting on a Sunday morning, it provides the excitement of skateboarding in a safe and controlled environment, coupled with a strong road safety bias.   it has grow from its conception in November 1978 with forty seven members to its present strength of seventy members, and numbers increase weekly.
     His other club, ""Mini Wheels"" was formed at the same time, and concentrates on road safety linked to cycling.   Membership again has swelled from an initial thirty members to eighty three, and has every indication of further growth.   Equipment was initially inadequate in quantity and quality.   Undaunted by this, Sergeant Vockins persuaded four major commercial organisations to make financial donations amounting to over 4,000 dollars 'without strings' to meet the needs of his thriving youth club.
     He has also established a close working relationship with the Royal Hong Kong Police Force Road Safety Organisation.   His expertise and assistance at major road safety promotions have established him throughout the Colony as a well known, respected and authoritative figure on the subject.
     It is a success story, achieved by the individual efforts of this one man in the space of a mere eight months.   It has meant hard work, and unbelievable enthusiasm, and sacrifice of many off duty hours.   the end result is a dramatic improvement in road safety sense for our children throughout the Colony, two flourishing road safety youth clubs, excellent public relations for the army and the admiration of teachers, parents, and everyone else associated with his outstanding efforts.

Citation:   Lieutenant-Colonel Godden joined HQ PM (A) in December 1977 as the SO1 and Adviser of Special Investigations for his last tour of duty before retirement from the Army.
Within a very short time he had forged invaluable links with the Home Office and civilian police which have proved to be of a very great benefit to the Service.   He introduced the three-tiered system of investigation into RMP which immensely improved the overall investigative capability of the Corps and at the same time, raised the standards of investigations within provost companies.   He planned and implemented the restructuring of SIB in BAOR and UKLF, giving them a balanced structure which has greatly increased their operational efficiency and, equally importantly, raised their morale.   his brilliant direction and outstanding professional ability has been an inspiration to all who have worked with him.
He has kept the Corps thoroughly abreast of legal and procedural changes in the law and virtually single handed redrafted and edited the new Imprisonment and Detention (Army) Rules and attendant statutory instruments.   All this he has done in addition to the very heavy burden of day to day activities connected with his appointment.
Lieutenant-Colonels Godden's contribution to the good of the Service has been above and beyond the normal call of duty and should be recognised by an award.

Aldershot.   OC 6 Field Force Pro Unit, 160 Pro Coy.  September 1978 - December 1979.
Citation:    During the last two years Captain Bishop has been Operations Officer of 160 Provost Company and Force Provost Officer (designate) of the United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKLF).   In South East District he has carried out the normal functions of the second-in-command of a RMP company.   In this capacity he has continually exercised responsibility for a variety of tasks from the protection of VIPs to the security of the Aldershot Army Display, duties which have been undertaken against the continued terrorist threat to the Home of the British Army.
     His outstanding conrtribution over the last eighteen months has however been to the UKMF in which he is the only regular RMP officer.   The UKMF on overseas exercises comprised over 10,000 men and the full brunt of policing this force has fallen on his shoulders twice, once on Exercise BOLD GUARD in Jutland and in BAOR on Exercise STEEL TRAP.   On both occasions he has been responsible for the operational and peacetime policing of the force with a small detachment of men specifically brought together for the task.   It is largely due to his efforts, his preparation for the exercises and his outstanding ability to liaise with local national police forces that both exercises passed without one major disciplinary breach.
   On return from Exercise STEEL TRAP he was confronted with the equally formidable task of policing some 1,000 men of the UKMF deployed to NE Italy on Exercise DISPLAY DETERMINATION which due to the nature of the exercise and the real security threat posed by terrorism in Italy produced very considerable problems for Captain Bishop.   He was the primary link with the Carabinieri, which had had little previous dealing with the British Army and in this his achievement was outstanding.   With patience and immense tact he dealt with any number of misunderstandings caused by the language and differing temperaments.  He was at hand to help control the situation when a local ammunition factory blew up at Tauriano.   The detachments he deployed were instrumental in saving life and preventing a breakdown in public order.   One again the UKMF was able to leave Italy with a very high reputation for discipline and this record was due to a great extent to Captain Bishop's unstinting efforts.
     His services to the UKMF have been exemplary and in the highest traditions of the Royal Military Police.   He has created everywhere a rapport between military commanders and police officers many ranks his senior and of various nations, which has paid particular dividends in Europe and has made this small detachment a vital and much respected part of UKMF which has contributed to the standing of the UKMF with the NATO Allies of Denmark, Germany and Italy.

Citation:   WO2 Knock has been involved in Close Protection Duties since 1971.   After training by the SAS and by the Gendarmerie National he was the personal bodyguard to GOC Northern Ireland for two years.   He has undertaken numerous, varied, Close Protection operations for the Ministry of Defence and for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office since then.   When in 1977 it became necessary for RMP to undertake more formal training in Close Protection duties, Staff Sergeant Knock, as he then was, became the principal full-time instructor in BAOR.   Later it was decided that this training should be carried out at the RMP Training Centre, where Staff Sergeant Knock again became the principal instructor.   At this point there were no facilities, little equipment, insufficient transport and no Course Syllabus or Programme.   With enormous drive and determination Staff Sergeant Knock, without any officer directly in charge of him for long periods and often in the face of ignorance, apathy and even antipathy, created a highly effective and widely accepted Close Protection Training Wing.   It now has excellent facilities, recognisably the best six week instruction programme on the subject anywhere in the world, and a small group of dedicated expert instructors who were themselves taught the WO2 Knock.   His reputation with the military and civil security authorities in UK and West Germany is outstanding.   All of them respect his absolute professionalism and knowledge while admiring his complete lack of selfishness or posturing.
     In short, the RMP Close Protection Wing which has now been formally recognised and established, and its outstanding reputation, owe everything to his efforts which demonstrate quite exceptional dedication and an amazing capacity for sheer hard work.   Although he has now been promoted WO2 because of his single-mindedness he has perhaps forgone the further promotion which could have expected if he had been serving in an ordinary Provost Company.
     His achievements well withstand any examination and are particularly notable in that most of them were achieved while he was a Staff Sergeant.   He has done far more than any WO2, let alone a Staff Sergeant, could have been expected or required to do without sting and with conspicuous success.   Such achievement should be publicly acknowledged.

Citation:     Sgt Ralph was employed as the village policeman at Mill Hill and more recently in the capacity of Unit Crime Prevention NCO).   During his period as the village policeman, which covers from November 1978 he performed sterling work in providing permanent police cover over a large ares, densely populated with Service Quarters and families.   He continually worked long arduous hours to meet the requirement, and was always ready to respond, irrespective of the day or time.   He additionally undertook the task and responsibility of running the Mill Hill Youth Club which he built up to a thriving concern, devoting what was left of his spare time to this venture, gaining him further praise and gratitude from the staff at Mill Hill.
     Since July 1979 Sgt Ralph has been employed as the Unit Crime Prevention NCO, a task he has tackled with great verve, dedication and competence;  it was a comparatively new role for the Unit and by his tremendous enthusiasm and acquired knowledge Sgt Ralph has already built up a sound reputation for himself and established the Unit as an authority in this important field.   he is currently providing a most efficient service, which has become greatly in demand, to Units, Married quarters, and Service Clubs in the London District Area.   In all the tasks he has undertaken Sgt Ralph has always displayed great willingness and perseverance setting an outstanding example in the very highest traditions of the Corps of Royal Military Police, and it is strongly recommended that his invaluable contribution should be recognised by an appropriate award.

Citation:  During the period 29 October 1980 to 30 January 1981 major Thompson was continuously employed as the Officer in Charge of the prison interface force which was responsible for the direct handling of all prisoners.   He assumed his prison duties almost immediately after a lengthy convalescence following injuries received in a traffic accident and it is an indication of his determination and sense of duty that he at once set about the complicated business of forming an interface force.   this called for long and irregular hours and a considerable amount of organisation and planning all of which was carried out under pressure.   The force compromised members of the Royal Navy, Royal Military Police, Military Provost Staff Corps and Royal Air Force and it was his blend of tact, patience, flexibility and good common sense that ensure a harmonious working relationship between all these elements and the creation of a highly efficient force.   the direct handling of prisoners always carried with it the strong possibility of serious incidents occurring which could have resulted in unfortunate consequences and adverse publicity.   By his attention to detail and constant awareness Major Thompson saw to it that throughout his long spell at Frankland no such incidents occurred.
     Because of circumstances the interface force carried out far longer tours in the prison than other service elements.   The duties were unvaried and frequently monotonous but always vital and called for long hours of constant vigilance.   Over a protracted period of time they could so easily have led to strain and a certain demoralization.   Due to his excellent leadership and personal example the high morale of the force was maintained throughout.
     During his tour of duty he acted as the continuity link between the Prison Governor and his staff and four Military Commanders who were rotated monthly.   In this time his sound advice, expertise and diligence earned him the respect and esteem of all who were concerned in the running of the prison.
     Major Thompson made a major significant personal contribution to the success of the operation.   no other officer provided the continuity, stability and sound advice that he did over some very difficult periods.  He rose to the occasion well and was not found wanting in a task which taxed him fully and which was beyond the scope of his routine work.
     By his outstanding performance in this difficult operation Major Thompson represented the Corps of Royal Military Police and the British Army in a most exemplary manner.   as award by Her Majesty The Queen in recognition of his service would reflect not only a tribute to him but to his Corps and indeed the Police of the other two Services who did so much to make the operation so successful.   Throughout a most difficult and testing time he rose to the challenge magnificently.

Citation:   Staff Sergeant Yallop has been employed in the Audio Visual Aids Wing of the Royal Military Police Training centre since 1973, and has been involved with the use of Closed Circuit Television as an aid to training since its inception here.   When he started there was no user experience of such equipment in a Police training environment, no trained operator expertise and not studio facilities.
     A radio and television engineer by trade Staff Sergeant Yallop easily mastered the basic technicalities of the highly complex equipment, and has subsequently spent much of his own time and money in retraining and updating himself.   
     With enormous drive and determination Staff Sergeant Yallop, often without an officer or Warrant Officer directly in charge of him, and often in the face of ignorance and apathy, has established an eminently functional and professional studio and a widely acclaimed library of pore-recorded video tapes on all aspects of Military Police Training.    
     Recently he installed, single handed, a closed circuit television system in  the Static Police Training facility.   This system permits one instructor, operating from a central console, to monitor the progress of a number of students in assimilating instruction in a practical environment.
     His ambition to institute a course of instruction to train Military Policemen to use Closed Circuit Television equipment in an operational environment has been realised.
     His reputation with other military training organisations and the Sussex Police Training School is outstanding.   His knowledge and ability in this field are respected, admired and widely acclaimed.
     His achievements are unquestionably outstanding and are particularly notable in that many were achieved while he was a Sergeant.   Although now a promoted Staff Sergeant his single minded devotion to this specialisation has undoubtedly denied him the earlier promotion to this rank which he would reasonably have expected had he been serving in a Provost Company.   he has done more than any Staff Sergeant could have been expected to do and certainly infinitely more than his duty required.

RMP Berlin, 7 July 1982.   RMP Routine Patrol.
Citation:  At 0250 hours on Wednesday 7th July 1982 Corporal Campbell and another Corporal, both of the Royal Military Police Berlin, were on mobile patrol in the city when they received a radio message sending them to a block of service flats in Spandau.
     On arrival Corporal Campbell saw a female leaning out of a top floor window screaming that her flat was on fire and that she and her baby were trapped inside.   Instructing the other Corporal to report to the RMP Control Room, Corporal Campbell ran un the stairs and on arrival outside the flat found a drunken soldier, who subsequently turned out to be Corporal Edwards, who closed the flat door;  he did not have a key and was not able to give any coherent information to Corporal Campbell.
     As the landing was completely engulfed in smoke Corporal Campbell broke the door down and attempted to enter the flat.   he was unable to do so due to the volume of smoke, he therefore rushed down the stairs and demanded a wet towel from another tenant, he then made a second attempt to enter the flat but was again defeated by the toxic smoke.   He again ran down the stairs and demanded the service issue respirator from the ground floor tenant, and , wearing the respirator was able to enter the flat and by crawling on his stomach underneath the main bulk of the smoke was able to locate the room where Mrs Edwards was hanging out over the window ledge.   As he stood up beside her, she became completely hysterical, he therefore removed his respirator and tried to calm her down, but all she could do was to scream ""my baby - my baby"".   Corporal Campbell physically shook the woman to try and get her to stop screaming but he was unable to ascertain any more than that the baby was in another room.;   At this stage the fire was getting worse, he therefore assisted Mrs Edwards out of the flat and down to one of the neighbours.   He then returned to the flat and by crawling around was able to locate the child's bedroom.  Corporal Campbell tried to open the window; being unable to do so, he threw a lamp through the window and was then able to ascertain that the room was empty.   Corporal Campbell then commenced a systematic and thorough search of the entire flat, although during the search he was forced to retire on several occasions due to the intense heat.   On completion of the search and having satisfied himself that the flat was empty, Corporal Campbell again approached Corporal Edwards who informed him that he had remembered that the baby had been left with some neighbours.   The flat was extensively damaged by the intense heat and smoke of the fire before the Fire Brigade arrived.
     There is little doubt that but for Corporal Campbell's prompt, determined and courageous action Mrs Edwards would probably have lost her life.   His complete disregard for his own safety is in keeping with the highest traditions of the Corps of Royal Military Police whose motto is 'By example - shall we lead'.

Citation:   Major R M Brumhill has served in the Territorial Army since 28 December 1965.   He gained his majority on 30 June 1978 and assumed command of 116 Provost Company Royal Military Police (V) on that date.   This TA company is the largest independent unit in the Royal Military Police.   The Headquarters is at West Bromwich and the eight platoons are widely dispersed, to Cardiff, Manchester and Coventry.  This dispersal poses serious problems in administration and training.   it is entirely due to Major Brumhill's dynamic drive, personality and magnificent leadership that this amorphous body of differing regional types has been welded into a most effective and efficient unit.    This efficiency was dramatically illustrated when his unit deployed in support of 1st British Corps on Exercise Crusader 80.   The ease with which it mobilized and carried out its subsequent tasks was ample proof of the high standards he obtains from all rank.
     Major Brumhill is the most professional Territorial army Officer serving in the Royal Military Police.   He makes time to command his unit.   Not only does he attend every training session, but spends at least one hour very day attending to company matters.   At the time he assumed command he was embarking on a new career in Merchant Banking.   It is a tribute to his quality that he has been successful in both both ventures.   He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for the county of West Midlands on 13 October 1981.
     He constantly tries to improve his command.   By successfully engineering the formation of a new detachment in Coventry in 1980 he opened up a new catchment area and raised his recruited strength from 65% in 1978 to 105% in 1981.   An idea, floated by him in conversation with the Corps Commander, resulted in the relocation of his mobilization equipment to UK.   His unit can now train more realistically with the equipment it will use when it goes to war and, most importantly, the time taken to get to its operational location has been but by two day.
     His contribution to the Army and, in particular, to his Corps is exceptional.   his devotion to duty and the manner in which he commands his company is a shining example which few can emulate.   His outstanding performance clearly deserves formal recognition.

The whole period has been most demanding being on of exceeding difficulty, pressure and shortage of resources.   his work has necessitated a thorough understanding of the needs of the Army, balanced against an unremitting determination to make economies.
     His response to this challenge has been magnificent.   His tasks have involved long hours, painstaking hard work. persistence and flexibility.   Overall his performance has been exceptional and is readily recognised as such by his colleagues in the other mainstream Ministry of Defence Branches.

He personally reduced the latter and devised ways of making savings amounting to 13M.   His plan is a truly outstanding achievement which should now be recognised by the award of the MBE.

     Corporal (Local Sergeant) SIMS is commander of the Mill Hill Detachment of London District Provost Company and he is the only Arms Explosive Search Dog Handler in London District.   At Mill Hill, where he has two more junior Royal Military Police corporals under his command, he is responsible for providing military police cover for the military establishments in quarters in that area.   These duties are conducted on the neighbourhood policeman principle and this requires long hours of work on a demanding task.    He has been totally accepted by and integrated into the military community there and this, in itself, is a tribute to his integrity, personality and dedication to duty.
     He does a full day of work almost every day of the week, either in local police work and supervising the inquiries of his juniors, or training and caring for his dog so that he is full prepared for his explosive search role.   This latter task demands frequent evening and week-end work in a wide diversity of locations.   Early hours, long days on standby, late nights and lengthy journeys are often necessary.   Official calls on his time have been far in excess of the normal call of duty over a prolonged period.
     During the last year, Corporal Sims has never failed in his duties.   Although he is full aware of the danger to himself, he ignores the risks in clearing and declaring safe each building and the surrounding area before virtually every military ceremonial event or social occasion where there is the possibility of a terrorist threat.   The venues include not only Horse Guards and a wide range of other military establishments throughout London and the South of England, but also at frequent international political conferences such as at Lancaster House and Gleneagles.   As a result, The Queen, members of the Royal Family, Cabinet Ministers, Heads of State, senior officers and the general public have all been protected by his work in varying degrees.
     Owing to the effort of solider such as he,  the reputation of the Army grows among both the civilian community and the Metropolitan Police, with which he co-operates frequently on ant-terrorist duties.   his selfless devotion to duty enables large and important sections of the military and civil communities in London to perform their official duties normally in a deteriorating security climate.   his courage and commitments to his duties are overshadowed by his charm, confidence and enduring good humour.   His contribution and dedication to duty go far beyond that to be expected of a substantive Corporal an merit official recognition.

Citation:     SSgt Briggs commands a small Police detachment at British Forces Antwerp with duties throughout the Low Countries.   His appointment is vital both in peace and on mobilisation and since the disestablishment of the DAPM HQ BFA his personal responsibility has increased considerably.
     Because of the size of the area and the wide variety of tasks SSgt Briggs has shouldered a heavy burden which involves frequent out-of-hours and weekend activity and the need to be permanently on call.   The demands on the section call for high morale, good training and sound administration and SSgt Briggs has responded magnificently.   he has shown leadership of the highest order.    Situated some 90 miles from his company headquarters he has also displayed initiative and judgement far above that normally required of an NCO of his rank and experience.
     It is in the critical field of liaison with the Belgian and Netherland civil and military police authorities, however, that in the absence of a DAPM, SSgt Briggs has found his greatest challenge.   It is to his credit that he has not only maintained these links, which are of a very highest importance in both peace and war, but  has succeeded in achieving a significant improvement.    To do so has taken a great deal of hard work over and above his other responsibilities and the results he has achieved have been invaluable to my headquarter.
     SSgt Briggs has performed outstanding service in all aspects of provost work in the Low Countries and particular.y in improving relationships.   he strongly merits special recognition.

Citation:  S/Sgt Major has been employed as CQMS of this unit since 1 Sept 81.   During this period he has, with the assistance of only one civilian store-man, been solely responsible for the efficient running of and accounting for the unit's entire equipment stores, including vehicle, technical and special to arm stores, in the most proficient and exemplary manner.   he is also required to maintain the barracks, this being the only RMP unit in BAOR with its own barracks, including all Works Services.   This involves a close working liaison with the PSA and with the other unit in the barracks.   he is fully aware of his many and onerous responsibilities and consistently works excessively long hours, through his own dedication and sense of duty, to ensure the efficient and smooth running of the unit an barracks.
     In his capacity as HQ Platoon Commander, S/Sgt Major has, by personal leadership and example, whilst under constant pressure, worked tirelessly to ensure the operational effectiveness of his men by sound organization and training, encouraging the driving them to achieve the best possible results under all conditions.
     In addition to his normal duties, he is frequently tasked, sometimes at short notice, to provide specialist equipment from both civilian and Service sources for Close Protection operations and to take part in these operations in his capacity as a trained body guard.   This has increased still further the workload on him and entails close and personal liaison with various outside police agencies.   He carries out all these extra commitments with the same cheerful, uncomplaining efficiency which he applies to everything he does.
     In his off duty time, he assists the local Youth and Driving Clubs by providing them with equipment and coordinating the production of other resources.   He plays a leading part in organizing and running the various wife's Club activities and is to the forefront in unit Anglo-German relations.   he devoted a great deal of his own time and effort to refurbishing the Corporal's Mess and produced most of the materials and fittings used.   He is always ready and willing to give guidance and assistance for unit functions and plays a full part in all aspects of the units' life when he could easily and justifiably have pleaded pressure of work as an exemption.
     S/Sgt Major invariably puts the interests of his work before all others.   His selfless devotion to duty and the welfare of others is in the highest traditions of the Corps of Royal Military Police and is highly deserving of public recognition.

     Sergeant Slocombe has just completed 27 months as the sole member of the Verden Police Post.   His previous 18 years of distinguished service have included tours of duty in Northern Ireland and Berlin.   Although he has been a highly professional and much respected policeman, with a quite exceptional sense of devotion to duty, it has been his actions as an outstanding member of the community in general that provides the extra thrust required for this citation.   He and his family have played a major part in establishing and maintaining superb links between the local German and British communities.   His fluency in German, abundant tact and personality are attributes that he has used to the benefit of the Army and its dependants when dealing with the German authorities.   When in the field he has used the same outstanding qualities, particularly during Exercise RED CLAYMORE and QUARTER FINAL (both major FTSs) to produce an immensely effective and high successful RMP/German safety control and movement organisation.   On these and many other smaller exercises his displays of initiative, his firm determination, as well as hit timely and diplomatic action in his dealings with the civil population and uniformed bodies have smoothed away possible causes of friction with the British Army.   Within the garrison itself Sgt Slocombe has been the model of a local community policeman.   his advice has been available at all hours  and he has always concentrated on the human side of justice rather than on its purely legalistic form.   he has worked tirelessly in the wider field and has been an outstanding organiser and supporter of functions in support of the local school, youth work and all garrison activities.   In particular his contribution to three Anglo-German weekends, to two Freedom Parades and several Tattoos and Horse Shows has been quite exceptional.   This quite outstanding local policeman has made an immense contribution as a crime preventer and as a community policeman in the widest sense.   His overall conduct and immense hard work throughout his military service justify this citation on their own merit, but his selfless personal contribution in the wider field, particularly over the past two years in Verden, make hi an exceptionally deserving candidate for recognition.

Citation:  Sergeant Easton has led his RMP Close Protection Team of four NCO's with distinction in a difficult environment, without the benefit of a normal military infrastructure to provide immediate support.   By his personal example, excellent leadership and energy he kept the professional skills of his team at a high lever of alertness over a sustained period.   Similarly by displaying initiative and imagination his weapons, radio and other equipment were maintained fully operational throughout their tour of duty to the highest standard without recourse to normal maintenance facilities.   He established and maintained high morale among his men, and excellent relationships between his team, the British High Commission, the British community and those Ugandan individuals and organisations with whom they had to work.
     In consequence, during a period when there were many incidents by day and night which threatened, or appeared to threaten the safety of the High Commissioner of his staff, the team invariably too prompt and effective action.   The systems and drills they had evolved and practised against such eventualities worked impeccably.   Led from the front by Sergeant Easton they displayed courage in repeatedly turned out without hesitation to respond to requests for assistance.   When fired upon, as happened on four occasions, they reacted with discipline, observing the rules of engagement, and returning fire only during one incident when this became necessary.
     The admirable performance of the team during this six month tour of duty was in the best traditions of the Service and reflects great credit on the leadership displayed by Sergeant Easton which was well beyond the call of duty.  HM High Commissioner for Uganda believes formal recognition is merited and has requested that this citation be submitted.

Citation:   Lieutenant Colonel Hughes-Jones commands the Special Investigation Branch of Military Police in the British Army of the Rhine (SIB RMP BAOR)   This unit is responsible for investigation of all serious criminal offences and sudden deaths involving BAOR personnel and their dependents, and for a variety of sensitive but non-criminal inquiries as directed.   His area of responsibility stretches from France, Belgium and Holland through West Germany, Berlin and included Bavaria, Sardinia and the British army Training Unit in Alberta, Canada.   His unit consists of 60 investigators and has been under strength for most of this period. 
     It has been a year of unprecedented pressure for SIB with major investigations into sudden deaths occurring in every region mentioned above, ranging from murder to misadventure, and death by negligence.   The most prolonged and demanding of these incidents was the Zeebrugge Ferry disaster in March at which he and his men were present from within a few hours of the event and his team remained for twelve weeks involved with the Belgian authorities and the Kent County Police in the identification and post-mortem examination of the victims several of  whom were members of British Forces Germany.   As this work reached a peak of activity, pressure was added by the terrorist bomb attack at JHQ Rheindahlen later in March which demanded detailed and intimate cooperation over the forensic investigation with the West German authorities in which he played a leading role.
     Later in August he was involved in the investigation following the death of Rudolph Hess in Spandau Prison in Berlin with the associated delicate political implications.   In addition to these important inquiries he has directed his team effectively to cover a constant series of quite exceptional investigations involving the interest of the national press.   These include drug abuse, fraud, and the internal discipline of units.   Meanwhile routine criminal cases have continued unabated.
     It is quite remarkable that he has achieved so much with so few over an area of responsibility wider than any other in his Corps.   There is not doubt that this has bee at the expense of almost continuous pressure on both himself and his unit.   So wide-ranging and demanding a service could not have been so effectively provided with the resources available without his thoughtful leadership and personal commitment which has been of the highest order, his extremely long working hours and by skilled assessment of priorities.   Lt Col Hughes_Jones performance and dedication has been over a prolonged period far beyond that to be expected in the normal course of duty.

Citation:   Corporal Downes has served with the Herford Detachment of 114 Provost Company RMP for three years throughout which he has been employed as the Police Office NCO.   His job involves the processing and checking of all police reports, the maintenance of case files and their distribution to the disciplinary authorities within Herford and Hameln Garrisons.   Both are busy locations with limited RMP manpower in which Corporal Downes in addition to his own police office tasks taken on responsibility for crime prevention and road safety.   These have been duties over and above those required by his normal employment and have demanded such greater commitment than that expected from an NCO of his rank and experience.
     In the field of road safety and crime prevention Corporal Downes has been tirelessly committed to the good of young people within the Herford Garrison.   He has cultivated the trust and loyalty of many children in the regular road safety and crime prevention courses which h has run in four separate military Schools.   As a teacher of crime prevention he has shown great enthusiasm and determination in his self scripted plays and demonstrations on the theme of ""Don't go with Strangers"".   The great success he has had in presenting this to children had undoubtedly enhanced their safety within the military community.
     Corporal Downes is a talented German speaker and has used hit facility to develop the liaison between the Military Police and the German Civil Police, Fire service and local authorities.   he is trusted and respected by the German community and has used his linguistic ability to establish strong ties between the your of the Garrison and the local population.
     Many of his activities in connection with the education of children have demanded that he give of his free time.   Throughout his three years at Herford Corporal Downes  has done so willingly, spending much time out of working hours with local children's groups.   Since April 1985, he has been the Scout Leader in charge of the Herford Cub Scout pack.   under his enthusiastic guidance the pack has flourished, now numbering some 30 children.   he is a fully qualified Scout Leader instructing in the evenings within the Garrison and running field camps at the weekends in the summer months.
     Corporal Downes is a deeply committed Christian and has since April 1986 been the Garrison Sunday School Superintendent.   he has responsibility for 6 other teachers and over 30 children.   he has created a welcoming atmosphere by his enlightened instruction and had gained the respect and confidence of both children and parents.
     Corporal Downes has excelled as a Military Policeman carrying much greater responsibility than that normally expected of his rank.   In addition, and in his own time he has been tirelessly committed to the good of young people within the Garrison.   The standard of Corporal Downes' service both on and off duty deserved the highest recognition.

Citation:   As APM Berlin for nearly two years, Colonel Ferrier has not only been responsible for all the normal military police duties within Berlin but he has also been in command of what amounts to the British frontier line force which supports West Berlin Police on the Sector and Zonal borders.   This has required him to be instantly available day and night to deal with the Russians in connection with any incidents on the borders or Autobahn, since he issues involved are normally such that they cannot be left to subordinates.
     He carried out these duties with conspicuous devotion, firmness, tact and good judgment and invariably in the most selfless manner.   By his insistence on the highest standards and his personal example of what service really means, he has succeeded in raising morale and efficiency of the Royal Military Police in Berlin to the highest level.
     Colonel Ferrier has taken enormous trouble to ensure that all visitors to Berlin understand what travel on the Autobahn and in East Berlin really involves, and the comparative infrequency of any incidents reflects the success he has achieved in this respect.   He has also always made it his business personally to conduct all important visitors and parties from the Defence, War and Staff Colleges, etc. on visits to the Berlin Wall and the wire obstructions erected by the communists on the zonal border.   Those concerned have almost invariably testified to the inspiration which he has brought to this task.
     It is considered that the contribution that this office has made to the standing of the British Garrison in Berlin merits practical recognition and he is strongly recommended accordingly for an award.

During this time he has shown outstanding ability and devotion to duty far in excess of the requisite qualities of his rank.   He has personally recruited over 40 men for the Territorial Army and has trained them to Regular Army standards.   For three years, he has trained and operated the requisite RMP TA duties for the K.A.P.E. displays at Aldershot and Southampton, and the Sovereign's Parade at RMAS.
He is completely devoted to the Army and his example is a constant inspiration to your young Territorial policemen.   The continuing success of this unit are largely due to his great efforts.

Citation:   Major Bush first enlisted into the DCLI in 1933 as a Private soldier, serving in India, Egypy, and the United Kingdom.   He rose to the rank of Warrant Officer Class II, and in 1941 transferred to the Airborne Forces and became a parachutist and glider pilot.   He received an Emergency Commission in 1943 and served in France and Germany.
     In April 1946 he was demobilised and immediately started working voluntarily for a RA Cadet Unit.   In May 1946 he re enlisted as a Gunner, in the newly formed Territorial Army, and was granted a Commission (TA) in April 1948.
     From that date, he has served continuously with the Territorial Army, rising to his present rank and for the past three years he has commanded 253 GHQ Provost Company RMP/TA, and is due to retire in the near future.
     Whilst commanding this unit, he has displayed tremendous enthusiasm, drive and powers of leadership, far in excess of normal expectation.   The exceptional all found efficiency of this unit, its success in maintaining a good level and standard in recruiting, and the enthusiastic attendances for parades are due entirely to the personal example and leadership of Major Bush.
     He has on many occasions, voluntarily carried out police duties in support of Regular units, thereby making a valuable contribution to solving present day manpower problems.
     To summarise, it is considered that his service during the past thirty years, culminating in his enthusiastic work and accomplishments in recent years, fully merit recognition.

Citation:     Since August 1980, Staff Sergeant (Acting Warrant Officer Class 2) Tennent has been the Special Investigation Branch Warrant Officer and senior Royal Military Policeman in Belize.   His responsibilities have included the investigations of all crime, deaths, other than by natural causes - the coordinaiton and tasking of uniformed Royal Military Police and liaison between British forces Belize and the local civil Belize Police.
     In carrying out his duties he has been faced with unusual difficulties.   Belize is an operational theatre in which the British Forces are dispersed over wide areas of inhospitable terrain with very poor communications.   The climate is oppressive and working conditions primitive.   In particular, the amoral attitudes of the native population and the sensitivities of a suspicious and outocratic local Police Force are major obstacles to effective military police work.   Since the Belize RMP detachment is isolated from other units of the Corps there is no one to whom its commander can turn for professional guidance of directions.   The burden on a young acting Warrant Officer has, therefore, been considerable.
     In the face of such odds, SSGT Tennent's achievements are remarkable.   Undeterred by such difficulties he has displayed unusual zeal, and professional skill to complete a series of complex investigations,   His results, by working long hours without complaint, in the form of clear, accurate reports have proved invaluable and have made a significant contribution to the effective policing of the Forces in Belize.
     Of particular value to the Force has been his ability to identify potential problems at an early stage.   His perspicacity, tact and advice in this respect has prevent may situations from developing into serious difficulty and earned him the respect and gratitude of his superiors in both the Army and Royal Air Force.   The calm efficiency together with the good humour and balanced maturity that he has shown in his approach to disciplinary problems are unusual in a man of his rank and experience.   That many of his investigations have been carried out in an atmosphere of a venal civil community with its attendant physical risks and temptations is a tribute to this dedication, integrity and moral courage.   It is also the more remarkable that he has, in addition overcome the professional jealousies of the local Police Force to establish an effective working relationship which has benefited the British Forces in Belize considerably.   As a result the reputation of the Royal Military Police in Belize, both amongst British Forces and outside has never stood higher.
     This achievement is a direct result of the outstanding performance of a young acting Warrant Officer which is worthy of formal recognition.

Citation:   For the past 2 years 8 months Staff Sergeant COWEN has been solely responsible for SIB investigations in Eastern Cyprus.
     He has carried out his duties in an exemplary fashion, and duet to his extreme conscientiousness and his cheerful acceptance of very long and irregular hours, he has produced excellent results.
     Numbers of serious cases have been brought to a conclusion due to Staff Sergeant COWEN's tremendous hard work and determination in pursuing his investigations.   In one of these cases a conviction was obtained for rape and attempted rape on a 14 1/2 year old girl;  and in another for the attempted murder and rape of a young girl.   The procurement of these convictions depended on the evidence that Staff Sergeant COWEN produced.
     He show tact and courtesy as well as persistence in pursuing his enquiries, and his extremely fair and correct manner in the witness box has earned him favourable comment fro officers and officials at Court Martial.
     A happily married man Staff Sergeant COWEN sets a high moral standard and commands the respect of the community in general.
     At work, due to his fine qualities, he sets an admirable example to his colleagues and to all those with whom he comes in contact during the course of his duties.

Citation:   Captain Hunt the PSO to the unit during the period September, 1960 to the present day, but he was also PSO to the unit from August 1953 - March, 1956, and January, 1957, to August 1958.   He commanded the unit during part of this time, when no TA officer was available.
     This has given him a very detailed knowledge and deep understanding of the problems of the TA.
     He has applied this knowledge, together with all his experience during his regular army career since 1935, to the service of the TA., without sparing himself in any way.
     The experience he obtained as Chief Instructor at the depot and training establishment, RMP, have been of inestimable value to the unit and especially to the officers and NCO's who have had the benefit of his instruction.
     Captain Hunt has retained the ability, not only to teach but also to practice the skills needed in the corps, and is the best shot and motor cyclist in the unit, in spite of the competition he himself engendered.
     His understanding of the young soldier is very great, and his example and standard he sets has left his mark of every member of the unit.
     The fact that he has twice commanded the RMP unit in Berlin, whilst itself evidence of his qualities, has given him unique experience to draw upon for the benefit of the TA.
     During the transitional period from TA, to AVR, he has by his tact and enthusiasm helped to ensure smooth progress within the unit, and it is very much to his credit that so many of the NCO's are remaining the the AVR, after this unit disbanded.

Citation:  Warrant Officer Class I ALLEN STANLEY GIBBS, Royal Military Police, has been the Regimental Sergeant Major of the British Army Support Unit at Headquarters Allied Forces Central Europe since August , 1965.   He has filled this post with marked success, displaying in this international environment a high degree of professional competence which has brought nothing but credit upon the British Army.
   He has been responsible for the organisation of numerous international parades and honour guards whilst serving at this Headquarters.   The organisaition of these parades and guards composed of officers an men of the Allied Nations serving at Allied Forces Central Europe Headquarters has called for considerable tact and diplomacy.   By displaying a rare combination of these qualities associated with his own hish standard of military bearing and discipline he has achieved results which have brought nothing but credit upon or country in general and the British army in particular.
     his untiring efforts both on an off duty to enhance the name of the British army have frequently been commended by the officers of other nations serving at this Headquarters.
     With these qualities which he has consistantly displayed together with his cheerfulness and imperturbability in his approach to the most daunting problems he has proved an excellent ambassador for the Army and his country.

Citation:  In early 1973 it was evident that a major investigational effort would have to be mounted in South East District to bring the high incidence of bomb hoaxes, assaults and thefts under severe control before the heavy cuts in manpower, necessary to reinforce Northern Ireland, seriously inhibited military police operations.   As the SIB were already at full stretch a number of general duties NCO's including Corporal White, were appointed full time investigators.
     Although not SIB trained, Corporal White very quickly began to influence affairs.   In Jan 73 after yet another disruptive bomb hoax message to the military exchange he traced the call to a barracks and within eight hours had interviewed 150 persons and obtained a confession from the perpetrators.   On other occasions by sheer determination and hard work involving long hours of painstaking investigation he identified a number of hoaxers who were subsequently convicted with the most salutary effect.
     He was equally effective in dealing with cases of assault, preparing evidence which led to a remarkable number of convictions.   In Mar 73 he successfully solved a particularly brutal attack upon a young soldier who was too frightened to talk.   Despite intimidation of witnesses and a great deal of evasion he brought the attackers to justice.   Again in J7ul 73 he dealt with a very complex case in which he displayed outstanding skill in recovering evidence which led, after two weeks of exhaustive investigation, to the conviction of three men for causing bodily harm.   There is no doubt that these successful investigations, with the many others which he carried out during his tour of duty, were instrumental in cutting down the increasing use of violence.
     Cpl white also dealt with a large number of theft cases, always in a most efficient and determined fashion.   In Aug 73 he was called to the scene of a theft and discovered that there had been 15 similar incidents.   Over a period of six weeks he recorded statements from 22 persons finally arresting the culprit who confessed to all 15 cases.   In Dec 73 he was injured arresting two burglars escaping from an officers' mess and the following month recovered a silver snuff box from a cigarette carton and arrested the thief.
     Eventually, after he had reached a state of total overwork and was near to exhaustion he was returned to general duties for the sake of his health.   He had worked incredible hours and seldom took a day off as his record of 241 cases in the twelve months' period must testify.   His achievements are all the more remarkable in that throughout this period he had to care for his wife, who is severely affected by multiple sclerosis and who has only a short time to live, and his tow small daughters.
     He carried out duties normally the responsibility of a senior NCO or warrant officer without any thought of self interest and made a contribution to the well being of the service far above the normal call of duty and that normally expected of a NCO of his rank and service.
     His remarkable achievements and exceptional devotion to duty in the face of dauting military and personal problems are deserving on an award.

Citation:   Corporal Allison has been this Company's Road Safety and Crime Prevention Officer throughout the period stated.   These appointments, in addition to his normal duties, incorporated lecturing and advising all units, sponsored organisations and individual members of the British Forces community throughout the Garrisons of Bielefeld, Paderborn, Guthersloh and Hameln.   Corporal Allison has shown outstanding dedication by giving up many hours of his free time to running Road Safety courses for Service schools; including cycling proficiency courses; German Traffic Law lectures to units, wives clubs and as part of Regular Garrison education centre briefings for new arrivals in BAOR.   It is noteworthy that during the period Corporal Allison has been responsible for these tasks the number of cases of impaired driving and traffic accidents have reduced significantly in the Company's area of responsibility.   Corporal Allison's Crime Prevention advice and lectures have assisted many units and military sponsored organisations to protect property and valuables, and have made school children and civilian members of the Garrison Community far more aware of personal security aspects of life in a military environment in Germany;  from the dangers of a young child accepting lifts from strangers to the current terrorist threat.   This programme has been further extended to make the British military community far more aware of their responsibilities to maintaining the good name of the Service whilst living in Germany.

Citation:    Pergamos is a small, enclosed and islolated military camp within the Eastern Sovereign Base Area, and close to the Turkish Federal State border.   It mainly consists of the Cyprus Joint Services Adventure Training Centre, a Primary School and Married Accommondation for  both military and UK Based Civilian families.   An unusually high rate of thefts, disturbances etc resulted in the need for a permanent police presence.   Cpl Hicks volunteered for the post.   The job required him to work very long and unsocial hours, and to be constantly on call.   In addition he had to be trained as a dog handler as he has a police dog to assist him in his duties.
     Cpl Hicks is an extremely smart, firm yet fair policeman, with a strong sense of commitment to the community he serves.    By his unstinting efforts, and by working long hours, he has virtually stopped all crime in the camp, and by his endeavours has maintained and enhanced the high reputation of his Corps.   His work in community relations has been beyond that which one would expect of his tank and service.   Large numbers of children, including Cypriots, have benefitted from his Cycling Proficiency Courses which he instigated himself, manufacturing the majority of his aids in his own spare time.   He helps to run the school soccer team, and the teenagers have responded well to the 'ad hoc' schemes he has organised for them, which he designs to test their physical and mental prowess.   Through his efforts, teenage crime is now virtually non existent in the camp.
     His intimate knowledge of the people and area has prevented many serious situations arising and he has been able to advise the welfare authorities on domestic problems before they have got out of hand.   his firm and fair manner of dealing with problems and people has led him to be well respected by the community (including the Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the area). who have placed absolute trust in him, and who often turn to him for advice and assistance.
     Through his total dedication to duty, by devoting countless hours of his spare time to helping other people and by his splendid example, Cpl Hicks has played a vital role in the lives of the community.

Citation:   Brigadier Davis has been Provost Marshal (Army) since 14 March 1971.   The emergency in Northern Ireland has made his period as professional head of his Corps one of particular strain and difficulty for the Royal Military Police.   Many new problems and commitments have arisen as a result of operations in Ulster, while previously existing military police tasks have not diminished, but, if anything, tended to increase.
     Brigadier Davis has been a tower of strength, both in Whitehall and in the way he has directed the activities of his Corps, throughout this time.   Nothing has been too much trouble for him, no problem has been too difficult to undertake, while his Corps has responded in outstanding fashion to all the various challenges that have come their way.   The exceptional contribution made by the RMP in operations in Northern Ireland is well exemplified by the 15 awards for gallantry given to the Corps since October 1967 while the excellent state of discipline in the Army as a whole reflects the admirable work done by military policemen in the Army's normal stations.
     Brigadier Davis' patience, common-sense, insistence on the highest standards, and, above all, ready co-operation with others have played a vital part in the work of his Corps during the last two years.   He has rendered service to the Army of the very highest order, and his work richly merits recognition.

This has helped to reduce dramatically the number of traffic accidents.   he is a 1st Kyu brown belt in Judo, and has been responsible for the organising and instructing at the Judo Club on the Retained Site.   This club has proved to be very popular with the soldiers and dependants and had done much to occupy their spare time.
     His intimate knowledge of the people and the area has prevented many serious situations arising and he has been able to advise, the welfare authorities on domestic problems before they have got out of hand.   His firm and fair manner in dealing with problems and people has led him to be well respected by the community, who have placed absolute trust in him and often turn to him for advice and assistance.   A good example of this occurred at 0100 hours 21 November 1981 when the young wife of a serviceman came to Cpl Portis, in a hysterical condition carrying her 2 year old daughter who was unconscious and had stopped breathing.   The woman gave the child to Cpl Portis and then ran off convinced that her daughter had died.   On examining the child Cpl Portis discovered that her tongue had dropped to the back of her throat.   By placing his fingers around the tongue and pulling it forward he managed to clear the air passage but the child showed no signs of life.   He therefore commenced mouth to mouth resuscitation and the child eventually began to breathe.   The child has since made a full recovery.   The clear presence of mind and the prompt and decisive action of Cpl Portis undoubtedly saved the child's life.
     Through his total dedication to duty, by devoting countless hours of his spare time to help other people and by his splendid example Cpl Portis has played a vital role in the lives of the community.

Citation for MBE 1947 - to date:  Background - Major COATES was commissioned into the TA in December 1934 in a HAA Regiment RA at PORTSMOUTH.   He served throughout the war in AA Command and was promoted Lt-Colonel in 1943 in command of 132 (M) HAA Regt.   He holds the Territorial Efficiency Decoration and 2 bars.
Citation  When the Territorial Army was reformed in 1947 Major COATES at once joined his old Regiment in PORTSMOUTH as a battery Commander.   in 1948 he had to move to LEICESTER for business reasons.   Despite the distance and extra time he had to spend on travelling Major COATES continued to serve with his Battery and took them to annual camp that year.   in 1950 he was asked to form a new unit in LEICESTER.   This he agreed to do and raised 76 (M) AA Fire Control Troop.   During the next four years this unit took part in each years UK Air exercises.   The Bde Comd's report for 1951 stated that ""the keenness instilled in the Troop by the CO has been reflected in the high attendance at drills and particularly on exercises."" Major COATES moved from LEICESTER to TUNBRIDGE WELLS in 1953 but continued to command his unit at LEICESTER making frequent visits and taking the to camp in 1954.   In November 1954 Major COATES transferred to 44 (HC) Inf Div (TA) and took over command of the Div Pro Coy.   To fit himself for command of this unit before taking part in the Divisional exercise ""DOVER CASTLE"" Major COATES gave up one week of his civilian holidays to attend a course at the RMP Depot.   Similarly, the following year Major COATES gave up a weeks holiday in order to attend the Provost Marshal's conference.   These are but two examples of the selfless and devoted service this officer has given to the Territorial Army.   As it has not been possible to find a suitable officer to fill the appointment of DAPM to 44 Division Major COATES carries out the duties of this appointment when required in addition to OC of the Div Pro Coy.   Major COATES is a married man with three children and he holds a responsible position in the National Provincial Bank.   Nevertheless he still gives a great deal of his time to the TA, far in excess of what is required to do in the course of his normal duties.  He is a member of three TA Associations, Kent, Surrey and Sussex, and attends all their meetings.   His unit is very widespread and has detachments in BRIGHTON and GUILDFORD, which he visits regularly.   He also makes a point of attending all exercises held by the three Bdes of the Div.   This entails spending a great deal of time in travelling, often late at night, which he does willingly and cheerfully for the Territorial Army.   Major COATES is the very best type of TA Officer with above average qualities of leadership, intelligence and initiative.   He has served the Territorial Army loyally and unselfishly over twenty three years.   He has now reached the age limit for his rank and will be retiring from the Territorial Army this year.   He is most strongly recommended for this award.

2846,2460,,5,51578,6,1988-12-31,"New Year Honours.   Captain Robert William Silk (522697), OC Drug Intelligence Team SIB RMP, UKLF.   18 Apr 86 to 13 May 88.
Citation: In April 1986, Captain Silk was appointed as the first full time Officer Commanding, Drugs Intelligence Team, SIB RMP UKLF and remained in post until May 1988.   An ad hoc team had been formed by SIB RMP UKLF in 1984 in response to the Army command's growing concern at the continuing increase in cases of drug abuse by soldiers, but its primary purpose was to assess the possible extent of any drug problem in the UK Field Army, rather than to initiate measures to combat and prevent misuse of drugs by soldiers.
     The period of Captain Silk's command of the Drug Intelligence Team (DIT) has been a particularly innovative and demanding one with DIT being at the very forefront of the Army's continuing battle against the threat of drug abuse.   Captain Silk has been personally responsible for implementing radical changes in the concept of DIT operations to focus on specific targeting both of individuals and premises, thereby increasing the team's effectiveness both in terms of acquiring drug intelligence and in coordinating follow-up investigations in cases of alleged or suspected drug abuse.   In 1987, almost a half of all persons reported for drug related offences in UKLF arose directly out of DIT operations.   More importantly and despite its covert role, the work and reputation of DIT has had a considerable deterrent effect and has contributed significantly towards reducing the incidence of reported drug abuse in the UK Field Army.
     Captain Silk's personal commitment and contribution to DIT cannot be overstated.  He has been responsible for all aspects of internal recruitment, selection, training, operational deployment and control, and for administration of the team whose 'cutting edge' comprises young military policemen and women who, because of their covert role, spend only six month on DIT duties.   This frequent but necessary changeover of operatives greatly exacerbates the difficulties of maintaining the team's cohesion and esprit, which has only been achieved through Captain Silk's awareness and sensitive handling of potential problems arising, thereby minimising any adverse affect on morale.   his leadership, enthusiasm and personal example have been vital ingredients in motivating young NCOs in circumstances which may at first appear to them to be glamorous but which in reality are frequently monotonous and uncomfortable, always stressful and sometimes potentially dangerous.   Captain Silk has been the driving force of DIT operations over a two year period.   He has worked intolerably long and unsocial hours, often away from his family at short notice for protracted periods, but never once shirking the need to do so.   He has developed essential points of contact with police, HM Customs and other drug enforcement agencies throughout the UK and by working jointly with those agencies has assisted in removing sources of supply from areas frequented by soldiers.
     As ex officio advisor on drugs related matters to the RAEC Centre, Beaconsfield, he personally devised imaginative and realistic exercise scenarios for inclusion in the man management modules of both EPC and EPC (Advanced) courses, which have effectively and significantly raised the lever of awareness among supervisory ranks of the threat to their soldiers from drug abuse.
     In conclusion, Captain Silk's work over the past two years represents the single most significant contribution by an individual towards the Army's continuing successful measures to prevent and combat the misuse of drugs by soldiers.

Soest, Germany.   Citation for BEM:  Sgt Abdy is employed as a community policeman in Soest.   Working entirely on his own he is responsible for policing some 200 British Military families.   His was one of the first such appointments in a pilot scheme introduced by RMP in 1st British Corps to help improve the general welfare of families by providing a more personal service to the military community.   Sgt Abdy's performance in this new and important task has been nothing short of outstanding.   As a military policman he has consistenly produced results of  a standard more normally associated with one with much more experience and had drawn upon his vast store of patience, skill, tact and diplomacy to prevent and detect crime.   Recognising the potential difficulties of policing a tri-national community he promptly established an effective and lasting liaison with the most senior officers of the local German and Belgian police agencies and in consequence has resolved a myriad of problems quickly and efficiently.   In doing so he has won the respect and confidence of everyone and has made a significant contribution to the continuing harmony which exists between the three communities.   His total commitment to his own community is remarkable.   He has built up an enviable degree of trust and cooperation with units and families in the area by being always available to offer help and advice with any problem, particularly those of a domestic, welfare or disciplinary nature.   He has a realistic and common-sense approach with people of all ranks and ages and this justifies their trust in him.   Despite the long and irregular hours demanded by his work he still finds time to organise extra-mural activities for the community;   he recently organised an Anglo/German pop concert in aid of two disaster funds and plays a leading role teaching  safety to the local children and running activities for the youth club and community centre.   Such is his popularity that the community recently petitioned against his routine posting to another provost company.   In his 2 years in the appointment, most of which he served in the rank of Corporal, he has, through his determination, resourcefullness, initiative and selfless devotion to duty, demonstrated the true value of his role in the community.   In view of his rank and service I consider him to be most worth of official recognition.

2848,2462,,5,51578,5,1988-12-31,"New Year Honours.   Lt./A/Capt. Ian Colin Ambrose (524248), Det. Commander SIB Berlin.   RMP.
Citation:   In Jun 1987 circumstances came to light in Berlin which indicated that for some time a custom of bullying and brutal behaviour had developed amongst the private soldiers of an infantry regiment the serving in the city.   So serious and numerous were these incidents that it was judged imperative that a rapid positive remedy was needed in order to repair the damage which had been caused to morale and discipline within the unit.
     The investigation of these incidents fell to Capt. Ambrose and his small team of Military Police Special Investigators.   What emerged is probably one of the most extensive and demanding enquiries undertaken within the Army in recent years.   The task which faced Capt. Ambrose was a daunting one.  Firstly, he had to deal with the numerous offenders and bring the to trial rapidly in order to minimise residual effects on the regiment.   To do this he had to overcome a powerful reluctance to speak to anyone outside the regiment which only changed as the enquiry began to be successful.
     At the same time he became involved in serving the special information needs of the Military Commander in Berlin who, because of the particular circumstances which exist there, took a deep personal interest in this affair and monitored the investigation progress on a daily basis over many months.   This special responsibility was ably borne by this officer, who, though only commissioned for one year, met all the demands placed upon him with a good grace and total professionalism.
     From Jul to Nov and beyond, as trials now come to court, Capt Ambrose has remained totally committed to this task, normally working long hours, seven days a week, without sparing himself.   In this he has been loyally supported by his charming wife who has seen little of her husband as a result.    In the circumstances it is also remarkable that, rather than earning the animosity of the Battalion by investigating, Capt Ambrose has now achieved a very close and warm relationship with the Unit who have attributed much of their success in overcoming the effects of the trauma to the sypmathetic, supportive and intuitive handling of affairs by this officer.
     During these long and very trying months in Berlin, the ability of this officer to identify the important issues and deal sensitively and rapidly with each successive crisis, whilst remaining totally professional, went far beyond the normal call of duty and deserves special recognition.

2851,2465,,5,51171,6,1987-12-31,"New Year Honours.   Captain Frank Michael Lindop (519987).  OC 87 Section SIB/RMP, (Dusseldorf).   1 Jan 1987 - 30 June 1987.
Citation:  Capt Lindop has been employed as the officer in charge of Royal Military Police special investigations throughout the Low Countries and in part of West Germany.   The cases he has dealt with include rape, indecency to children, robbers, sudden death and fraud.   As a result he has been under constant and considerable physical and mental pressure.   The results he has achieved and the manner in which he has achieved them give rise to this high prestige with both civil and military colleagues.   His outstanding performance is clearly demonstrated in two recent incidents.
     On Friday 6 March 1987 about 2130 hours, whilst deployed on exercise in Antwerp, Captain Lindop heard the first reports of the ferry disaster which had occurred at Zeebrugge.   Accompanied by one other investigator he went to the scene and began to make the series of reports which enabled the British military authorities to take such timely and effective action.   He took immediate steps to organise and deploy the manpower available to deal with the large number of casualties.   The cool and comptent manner in which he handled the situation did much to help clear the inevitable chaos and confusion and mad it possible for other agencies to react positively.   in conjunciton with the Belgian authorities, he quicly established a system for dealing with the bodies which were being brought ashore.   As reinforcements arrived from Germany he took command of all available RMP resources and maintained a steady flow of invaluable information until relieved by a senior RMP officer.   He remained in Zeebrugge without a break until 21 March 1987, where he was acknowledged as a valuable part of the Belgian and British police team.
     On his return to base in Germany he was given little time for rest, because on 23 March 1987 a car bomb exploded outside E Mess, Rheindahlen Garrison, resulting in many injuries and massive damage.   Captain Lindop was immediately involved in dealing with ye another major incident.   The police operation continued throughout the night of 23 March and into the next day when it became clear that the German authorities would be assuming the primary responsibility, whereupon he adopted a supporting role.   His contribution to the operation throughout the night of 23/24 March and subsequently was as energetic and professional as if the pressure of the previous weeks had not existed.
     There were two common factors to these disasters.   Firstly Captain Lindop's calm, firm handling of affairs in the confusion and stress of the hours following a disaster and his ability to identify the important issues and deal professionally, sensitively and compassionately with human situations over prolonged periods.   Secondly, the unremitting intensity with which he devoted himself to the task in hand without thought for personal interest, tiredness of frustration.   In all matters he placed the interests of others in the task in hand before self.
     Capt Lindop's performance of his duties had gone far beyond what is normally required and expected and calls for special recognition.

Citation:   In 1985, the British Army of the Rhine formed a Drugs Intelligence Team drawn from members of the Special Investigation Branch, Royal Military Police.   This was in response to a substantial rise in the number of drugs cases investigated by the Special Investigation Branch which sadly confirmed that the Services are not insulated from the drugs problem affecting young people in the community at large.
     The team is dedicated to the Gathering of drugs intelligence by deploying operators who undertake covert surveillance and intelligence gathering operations where the drug sub-culture thrives.
     Staff Sergeant Crampton Royal Military Police Special Investigation Branch has been a member of this team since May 1986.   Although primarily involved in supporting 76 Section SIB covering the areas Bielefeld, Detmold, Minden, Herford and Hameln, Staff Sergeant Crampton's duties have taken him further afield in British Army of the Rhine.   Additionally because of his combined Police talents and outstanding teaching abilities, he has also been heavily involved in the instruction of young members of the Royal Military Police and Women's Royal Army Corps Provost who are attached to the Drugs Intelligence Team.   Staff Sergeant Crampton has planned and undertaken a number of covert missions where he has operated in the dangerous and violent environment where controlled drugs are abused.
     Throughout, he has continually been an inspiration to his colleagues; both in the Royal Military Police and German Police, and as a result of his high professional skills, a number of successful arrests have been made to persons involved in the supply and misuse of drugs.   he is an NCO who has brought to the recently created Drugs Intelligence Team qualities of energy and boldness that were greatly needed in this new venture to ensure the Armed Services were equipped to tackle the potential of a drugs menace.   Staff Sergeant Crampton has worked tirelessly at his task and his handling of the various drugs involvement throughout BAOR has been exemplary.   He has succeeded in exerting the greatest possible pressure on offenders but simultaneously maintaining first class relations with units involved.   he is thorough, sensible and has an enviable reputation as an investigator, not only with the Drugs Intelligence Team but in the wider field of RMP employment.
     During March and April this year SSgt Crampton was part of the joint Belgian/British police team who dealt with the aftermath of the Zeebrugge Ferry disaster.   His task during this time was to deal with the bodies of victims of the disaster when they were first brought ashore.   He spent many days in this distressing and nauseating environment without losing any of his robustness and by his example helped others of the team to deal with the emotional stress involved.
     Staff Sergeant Crampton's selfless devotion to duty has involved the highest sense of respect and loyalty with his Service and civil police colleagues which in turn has greatly enhanced the reputation and standing of the British Army in Germany.   Such conduct in his tour of duty is beyond the call of duty and deserving of official recognition.

Citation:  Major Bacon was appointed the Special Operations Officer BAOR in January 1987.   It was a new post whose incumbent is responsible for the Close Protection of those at risk from terrorists or others in BAOR.
     He first had to establish liaison with and earn the respect and cooperation of sister organisations, particularly the German Police and their Special Protection Units.   He also had to gain the confidence of units being visited by persons he was protecting.   These tasks involved extensive travelling, patient and meticulous briefings, preparation and conduct of joint training.   In establishing the excellent liaison and
reputation he now enjoys, Major Bacon never waivered in his persistence and never balked at the long unsocial hours it absorbed.
     Major Bacon commands a team of full time specialist personnel and is reinforced for operations by qualified personnel from other Provost units.   In order to maintain the required level of alertness and skilled reaction, a constant and intensive programme must be managed.   He preforms this function in a highly professional manner and in spite of being fifteen years older than his men, he maintains his lead from the front.   The level of physical fitness this requires of him entails many hours of individual effort.
     As his unit was new when he took command he had had to develop its accommodation, equipment and staffing needs.   Amongst a background of limited resources, the procedure to acquire his needs has required tenacity, persistence and patience which he has never failed to display.
     For some 150 days a year he is committed to active operations protecting ...ranging from HM the Queen and members of her family to senior officers and officials deemed to be at risk.   Once an operation commences he will have spent many days liaison, reconnaissance and preparation.   For the duration of the operation he is personally and entirely committed for up to twenty hours a day.
     Major Bacon has created a close protection service for BAOR which is effective and discreet.   He has done so by exhibiting persistence and stamina far in excess of that normally expected in peacetime.   In effect he is constantly on operations relegating his time for himself and his family to a distant second place.   The result has been effective and credible protection and a significant contribution to counter terrorism, Major Bacon's conduct and service fully merit recognition.

Citation:     WO2 Virgin has commanded 19 (Support) Platoon since 2 April 1986.   This unit consists of 15 police advanced drivers operating fast pursuit vehicles throughout the Former British  Zone of Germany, linked by radion telephone to an operations room in Bielefeld.   WO2 Virgin is responsible for the policing and control of the activities of the Soviet Military Liaison Mission to C in C BAOR (SOXMIS) as directed by G2 Sy HQ BAOR.   This is an internationally sensitive task requiring great tact and diplomacy while remaining firm but fair in dealing with the aggressively confident Soviet Intelligence officers within the Mission.   19 (Support) Platoon fulfills an essential task which requires detailed personal command and control by WO2 Virgin.   He alone is responsible for decision making at incidents involving the mission, without immediate recourse to higher authority, and in a period when East-West relationships have been under scrutiny, the repercussions of making even a minor mistake would be of international significance.
     Since 1986 SOXMIS intelligence gathering activities have increased in intensity and WO2 Virgin has frequently been faced with the control of a high speed chase, often at night as a SOXMIS vehicle attempts to evade detention having been found in violation of a Restricted Area.   Because of this he has had to work long periods over and above the expected of this high pressure appointment.
     WO2 Virgin has over the last 3 years borne enormous responsibility for the intimate control of highly sensitive policing operations.   Directly comparable operations in the American and French Zones are commanded by Majors of several years standing.
     Of the many Warrant Officers who have held his position WO2 Virgin stands out as a man of singular dedication.   WO2 Virgin's command and leadership has been of direct measurable benefit to SOXMIS policing operations and to the welfare of the men and families under his command .   By his motivation and commitment he has inspired confidence amongst his subordinates ensuring the maintenance of morale over protracted periods of duty in anti-social hours.
     His clear and decisive leadership has greatly enhanced the reputation of his Corps and the Army as reflected to HQ BAOR by the Senior German Police officers of the forces with whom he works.

Citation: Staff Sergeant Andrew Mudd was leader of the Royal Military Police Close Protection Team (CPT) at Beirut from November 1988 to May 1989.   With the outbreak of heavy fighting between the Lebanese Army and Christian Militia on 14 February, and of shelling between the Lebanese and Syrian armies and the action which has continued since 14 March, the team were exposed to considerable danger in carrying out their responsibilities.   S/Sgt Mudd's quiet, calm and professional leadership during this period was outstanding.   he displayed exemplary qualities of courage and leadership in rescuing members of the staff from their apartments while under machine gun and rocket fire on 14 February.

Citation:   Staff Sergeant Blaza is a senior non commissioned officer who has served in the Royal Military Police Training Centre for the past 4 years.   He is currently on an Extended Career Regimental Engagement.   he has primarily been employed in the Quartermaster's Department as the Accommodtion Non Commissioned Officer.   As such he has made a sustained major and most significant contribution to the welfare and support service catering for the 300 or so single soldiers and 53 officers and other rank families who occupy accommodation in Roussillon Barracks, Chichester.
     In addition to his normal military duties which he has carried out with skill, compassion, considerable innovation and enthusiasm he has devoted much time and effort to off duty extra mural regimental activities.   he has spent may off duty hours concerned with the administration and maintenance of the two Regiment Corps Chalets and acting as Verger to the Corps Chapel.  Without thought for his own personal commitments, he has carried out the important and time consuming task of attending to the personal welfare and daily needs of the occupants of the chalets.   many of these are elderly and infirm or who are recovering from a personal or family crisis.   During the winter months ha has single handed carried out an annual redecoration and maintenance programme.   He has carried out many minor repairs and payed regular inspection visits during the close season.
     He has also on a completely voluntary basis acted as the part time caretaker of the Corps Chapel.   As Verger he has provided invaluable assistance to the two Churchwardens, helping them maintain and develop the chapel as the spiritual house of the Corps.   On his own initiative he commissioned a heating and lighting study of the chapel which resulted in the instillation of a new, modern and most economical and effective system which has greatly enhanced the comfort for all.   He is also a regular contributor to the floral displays which beautify the chapel.
     The unselfish commitment and inspiring example he has made in these extra mural activities are in keeping with the highest traditions of both the Royal Military Police and the Service and are deserving of recognition.

Citation:  Staff Sergeant Williams joined as a junior Guardsman in 1967 going on to serve with the Coldstream Guards in the United Kingdom, Berlin and Northern Ireland before transferring to the Royal Military Police in 1974.   Since then he has served in Belize, Hong Kong, British Army of the Rhine and in the Close Protection role as driver and bodyguard to the General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland in 1979/80.
     In March 1988 Staff Sergeant Williams was posted to London District Provost Company.   He undertook the task of Unit Search Adviser, at that stage an un-established but necessary position.   Using his own initiative and experience gained in Northern Ireland he began to enhance his post as well as crime prevention and search skills within the Company;  the latter particularly at a time when all methods were needed to counter terrorism.   He systematically developed search teams, encouraging JNCOs to become interested in a facet of work that is often time consuming, tedious and with little glamour or praise attached to it but nevertheless a vital task.   It is to his credit that he has passed on his dedication and professionalism to these search teams.
     Staff Sergeant Williams justified the enhancement of the Dog Section with extra Arms Explosive Search Dogs and obtained professional equipment and clothing.   At all times he sought the advice from both military and civilian experts, gaining their respect as well as building vital and excellent close working relationships with those organisations, particularly the Metropolitan Police Anti Terrorist Branch.
     Staff Sergeant Williams coordinates many search tasks at high profile Military and civilian functions attended by Royalty and Prominent Political and Military figures.   The time and attention to detail given to such prestigious events is also evident in all the mundane and day to day search tasks.   His advice and knowledge is often sought by the civil authorities regarding certain locations particularly the Royal Albert Hall.   Taskings may take place in London or all over the country especially when providing assistance to the Royal Navy at High Profile Events.
     At a time when the civilian police are becoming ever aware of their vulnerability and lack of knowledge regarding terrorist explosive devices and their means of initiation it is a mark of their respect for Staff Sergeant Williams' expertise that he is asked on many occasions to lecture to Police Constables and Inspectors alike.   His skills are also sought by military personnel and their families and whatever the audience he gives up many hours of his spare time in preparation and presentations.
     His devotion and unselfish attitude were clearly illustrated during the Mill Hill bombings.   Staff Sergeant Williams was one of the first on the scene searching the debris and freeing trapped and injured personnel including the young man who eventually was to succumb to his injuries.   This was done unhesitatingly and without any regard for his own safety in view of the precarious nature of the building, or that there might be a secondary device planted.   it was typical of his modest nature that he made little of his exploit.
     Without prompting, Staff Sergeant Williams through his own initiative, drive and enthusiasm has developed one of the foremost military search facilities.   Most of his work, be it supervising a search task prior to a Royal Event, advising WRAC and wives on personal security or lecturing on explosive devices to the Metropolitan Police, is done quietly and professionally and often goes unnoticed and unrewarded.   With just over a year left to serve Staff Sergeant Williams might easily be expected to rest on his laurels - it is a mark of the man's devotion that he is taking on more lecture commitments and hopes to see the expansion of the Dog Section to cope with the increase of taskings.

Citation:  Staff Sergeant Davies commanded 2 Platoon, 203 Provost Company which was under tactical command of HQ 7 Armoured Brigade for Operation Granby.   His duties required him to move early through the obstacle breach in wheeled vehicles, alongside the armoured reconnaissance, in order to lay out the brigade rendezvous line on the far side of the breach, and establish the Forming Up Point (FUP) for the Brigade Administrative Area (BAA).   Thereafter, he would be responsible for signing the axis of advance so that the BAA could follow hard up on the Brigade in order to provide logistic support.
On 25 February1991, early Allied successses had advanced timings for the Brigade's passage of lines, and the forward elements were already some four hours ahead of the BAA by the time the FUP was reached.   Best speed was therefore required if the BAA was to provide close logistic support to the Brigade and, in turn, receive protection on the battlefield.
The FUP proved, on occupation, to be covered in Multi Launch Rocket System bomblets to the extent that the BAA group sustained three wounded and one killed within a short time of arriving in the area.   Staff Sergeant Davies's platoon itself had already lost one Landrover and a motorcycle due to this hazard.   With the onset of darkness and with rain and cloud making visibility almost nil, Staff Sergeant Davies was ordered by the Brigade Provost Officer to clear safe lanes, to allow the BAA to form up and pass through the FUP.   The alternative was clearly the loss of critical logistic vehicles and possibly more lives.   He, therefore personally led his soldiers in clearing the necessary routes of bomblets - in full knowledge of their potential lethality - using issue shovels.
Despite an explosion early in the proceedings, which fortunately inflicted no injury, Staff Sergeant Davies continued to work against the clock to clear the way for the 600 plus vehicles of the BAA.   In due course, the BAA was able to occupy its FUP and proceed up the line of advance with minimum delay.   Staff Sergeant Davies continued to recce and lay the route for the BAA through the next 200 kilometres of enemy territory,   throughout motivating an increasingly tired and stressed platoon through many battlefield hazards.
Staff Sergeant Davies's act was one of exemplary personal courage and robust leadership.",,,

Citation:     After a decision to establish a new Investigation Department in July 1975, Staff Sergeant  O'Donnel was nominated as the supervisor.   His previous two years service as a Chief Clerk naturally resulted in unfamiliarity with new legislation and investigation techniques.   Quickly, by dogged determination and concentrated private study his knowledge and expertise became superior to that of his contemporaries.
     From virtually nothing, by exceptional drive and enthusiasm he has produced an investigative element of the unit which provides a highly respected and professional service to units in the District.
     In 18 months, due to his inspiration and determination the detection rate in investigations has increased by 130% and resulted in 31% more crime being reported.   To achieve these exceptional results, by personal choice he has regularly worked over 80 hours per week.
     The fact that military crime within South East District has at least been kept at a constant lever can undoubtedly be credited to Staff Sergeant O'Donnell's dedication above the call of duty.
     His magnetic inspiration and influence has extended throughout the unit enthusing relatively inexperienced  Non-Commissioned Officers into becoming confident and competent Military Policemen.
     He has carried out his duties as a Platoon Commander with exceptional leadership and management sills.   The problems of his men have literally been resolved at any time of the day or night.
     The exceptional inspiration and example that Staff Sergeant O'Donnell has shown will have a lasting effect on the unit and on all personnel as they progress in their careers.

Citation:    SSgt Price had only a few months remaining of his twenty two year engagement when he was selected from 115 Provost Company RMP, where he was a highly regarded platoon commander, to establish and run the RMP Mounted half section at Sennelager.   Despite agreement for him to spend his remaining nine moths service in the UK, he readily accepted the challenge knowing that it would delay his departure from BAOR.   The task entailed an inordinate amount of additional planning and work, over and above his normal duties, to ensure the half section became operationally viable.   he was responsible for the selection of the horses in conjunction with the RAVC, their collection from UK and retraining them to meet police duties commitments throughout 1 (BR) Corps, which demanded considerable knowledge of stable management and riding skill.   Throughout the transition period he accomplished his duties, which also entailed the procurement of equipment and suitable stabling, with enthusiasm and dedication beyond that normally expected of a Staff Sergeant.
     There is no doubt that without his personal effort, zeal and purposeful approach the venture might not have succeeded, nor gained the recognition the section now enjoys;  a highly motivated, operationally competent and professional mounted military police detachment.   By SSgt Price's unstinting enthusiasm, sheer dedication and personal sacrifice, he was able to handover a formally established and highly activated mounted half section.
     In addition SSgt Price was also involved in extra mural activities connected with the BAOR equestrian events.   he readily gave up his free time to instruct not only service personnel but dependants and children.   He greatly helped the pony club at Sennelager on many occasions and the BFG pony club camp.
     Despite being in his last year of service, after a splendid and varied career with RMP, his diligence and tenacity never wained, in fact it surged to achieve a final goal.   There is no doubt that due to his excellent police duty knowledge and superb equestrian skills he as able to create a thriving and highly regarded Royal Military Police Mounted Detachment.

Citation:   Staff Sergeant Salmons is the non commissioned officer in charge of the (BR) Com Z detachment of 101 Provost Company RMP, the only in theatre regular RMP on the British Line of Communication.   As such he was responsible for the establishment of effective liaison with the Host Nations' (BE, NL) military and civil police, judiciary and law enforcement agencies, the provision of RMP operational support prior to the arrival of reinforcements and, finally the policing of (BR) Comm Z.
   His work during the exercise planning and preparation stages and throughout LIONHEART operations was outstanding, far above that normally  associated with his rank and service.
     Early in the planning stage, acting on his own initiative, he identified the many Host Nations' police agencies that would be involved in operations.   He mad contact with them and sought out their planning officers, invariably much senior to him, and identified himself as the in-theatre RMP point of contact.   He provided the Host Nations with the detailed information that they required and kept them informed of planning changes as they occurred.   he won their respect and confidence, no small achievement, and made inter-operability and close cooperation between the Host Nations' police and RMP possible.   This was crucial to successful operations in (BR) Comm. Z.
     In the preparation stage S/Sgt Salmons made many constructive suggestions on the organisation of the Convoy Marshalling Area (CMA) and produced the equipment required to operate it.   His ideas were accepted and subsequently proved during actual operations which were greatly facilitated because of this SNCO's initiative.   He was instrumental in the smooth operation of the CMA, the first important link on the line of communication.
     Finally, during LIONHEART operations S/Sgt Salmon's detachment successfully police the (BR) Comm Z dealing promptly and effectively with all police incidents in close cooperation with the Host Nations.   This was due to his leadership and preparatory work.   He also acted at the (BR) Comm Z RMP Operations Warrant Officer, and appointment normally held by a WO I (RSM), assisting the DAPM with the command, control and coordination of a three company group and making a most significant contribution throughout.
     S/Sgt Salmon's actions prior to and during Exercise LIONHEART were in accordance with the highest traditions of RMP and the results that he produced consistently outstanding in every aspect of his many and varied duties.   In view of his rank and service I consider them worthy of official recognition.

Citation:   Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Wyatt assumed command of 163 Provost Company RMP (V), a sponsored company recruited entirely from the Automobile association, in 1973.   Under his inspired leadership the unit flourished, was always fully recruited and earned an outstanding reputation.   During his period of command after one major exercise the Commander of the LSG UKMF commented that the company's performance was the best he had ever seen of a military Police company.   In 1974, when they spent their annual camp in support of RMP in South East District, the GOC remarked that that they were a shining example to the regular army in every respect.   More recently the Commander 8th Field Force stated that the Company's performance during Exercise CRUSADER was simply outstanding.   For a sponsored unit to gain such praise is a truly remarkable achievement.   Their tremendous contribution to the operational efficiency of the Army and their splendid example is testimony to the dedication and leadership of Lieutenant colonel Wyatt.   he inspired a sense of purpose and professionalism into this company which is reflected in their soaring morale and outstanding efficiency.
     Some measure of his achievement in this respect may be judged from the unprecedented action of the Governing Committee who, at a luncheon in his honour, made a presentation to him on his relinquishment of command.
     Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Wyatt's performance as commanding officer of a company of part time soldiers has been a shining example of devotion, outstanding and unselfish service, superb efficiency and absolute professionalism.   Such conduct is far beyond the normal calll of duty and should be recognised by an award.

Citation for CBE:  Brigadier Oulton has now completed his tenure of 3 years in the appointment of Provost Marshal and Inspector of Prisons - an appointment he has filled not only with success but with distinction.   As Commander of the Corps of Royal Military Police he has proved himself and imaginative and far sighted administrator.   With patience, understanding and tireless determination he has demanded the standard of performance which is now universally acknowledged.   Perhaps his greatest achievements lie in the reforms which have been effected in Military Corrective Training Establishments.   His energy, integrity and vision have transformed the M.C.T.E. Colchester into a high grade training establishment which has won acclaim from Commanders and unstinting approval in Parliament.   His untiring efforts have been bent to the successful rehabilitation of the soldier as a useful member of the Army, and he has not spared himself to achieve this fine purpose.   His fine personal character and his unflagging enthusiasm have been reflected in the spirit of the Military Provost Staff Corps whose duties lie within the Corrective Establishments.   Their morale, their sense of purpose and their efficiency have made tremendous strides towards the goal which Brigadier Oulton had always in sight and which will long survive his term of office.   His contribution to the well being of the Army is worthy of high recognition.

Citation:   Major PRIOR has been serving in uniform continually since 1948 until the present day, firstly as a cadet, then as a Regular Soldier for nine years and subsequently as a TA officer and OC of 253 Pro Coy RMP (V).   Throughout these years Major Prior has shown enormous enthusiasm for military life and great dedication to his work as a soldier.
     Since 2964 Major Prior has been serving in 253 Provost Company RMP and has proved to be one of the most popular members of the unit in every rank that he has held.   He was Commissioned in 1969 and has been officer Commanding for the past three years.
     In spite of moving to Eastbourne where he has a responsible and time consuming job in local government, Major Prior hardly ever fails to turn up for a drill night or a training weekend, and often attends the Southampton Detachment training in addition to his normal Company duties at the Headquarters in Brixton.
     Throughout his tour in command, Major Prior has paid meticulous attention to demanding the highest standards from his men;  that these standards have been achieved is in no doubt after his recent performance on Exercise Crusader 80 where his company earned the very highest praise from everyone from the C-in-C to the local farmers.
     His considerable dedication and loyalty to the Corps and to the Service far exceeds that which is required an it is considered that this outstanding contribution to the Service should be recognized with an appropriate award.

RMP.  05/01/1987 to date.
Citation:   In 1986 RMP recognised the need to continuously improve the operational and cost effectiveness of the Provost Support it provides to the Army world wide and to manage resources to match commitments more efficiently.   The Corps had to change its management approach from a traditional reactive style to corporate planning, so that its activities could be measured, monitored and controlled against planned goals and objectives.   However because this change was innovative it was unclear how it could be effected.
Early in 1987 Lieutenant Colonel Theis joined HQ Provost Marshal (Army) and volunteered to help address the problem in addition to his heavy work load as SO1 Police Legal.   Without losing the momentum of his primary employment he read and consulted widely throughout the Ministry of Defence with Home Office police forces and analagous agencies facing similar difficulties and with centres of management expertise..   Starting from his firm formulation of legal knowledge and wide police experience he gathered a comprehensive understanding of the principle and process of modern management, identifying accurately those which apply to RMP.   He has appreciated the many complex issues involved, including the evolution of a Defence Management Strategy.   His assessment of their inter-relationship and the practical implications of conceptual options enable him to play a key role in designing the Provost Services Strategic Planning Approach (PROSPA).   PROSPA provided the basis for restructuring the RMP management organisation, the development of new control processes, the formulation of the RMP corporate plan and an information technology strategy to support RMP's drive to achieve greater operational and cost effectiveness.
Lieutenant Colonel Theis has acted throughout in the highest traditions of the military police on his own initiative, outside the specification of his own appointment and with a vision beyond his own specialisation has been instrumental in bringing about management development which already enhanced RMP's efficiency and effectiveness, which promises significant savings in the future and which may provide a prototype Defence organisations taking similar appreciation in line with the Govermnment's financial and management initiative (FMI) and service initiatives.

Jul 77 - Nov 79.
Citation:  Lieutenant Colonel ALLEN has just completed and outstanding two and a half year tour as Assistant Provost Marshal and Commander Royal Military Police in Berlin, during which he has set and maintained the highest professional standards by his un-stinted efforts and personal example.   The excellent performance of his duties has been recognised not only by the British community, but by the British Military Government, which equates to a medium sized embassy, the Allies, the West Berlin Police and the local community.   The special position of the Allies in Berlin produces many unusual situations which require handling with the greatest tact and diplomacy.   He has accomplished this in an exemplary manner, with commendable patience and understanding and having to react frequently to incidents of an international nature day and night.   The tasking of his limited and often overstretched police resources in their daily routine of road access, wall and wire patrols as well as normal traffic and disciplinary duties have been intelligently and sympathetically managed to the benefit of all concerned.   He has also sought and achieved the fullest cooperation with the Royal Air Force, the Allies, The West Berlin Police and has been exceptionally successful in maintaining the best possible relationship with the Soviets on all maters of right an access.
     His chief responsibilities for security and traffic control in the British Sector of Berlin have included the annual Queen's Birthday Parade, the Allied Forces Day Parades and two bienniel Tattoo's, which are major ceremonial functions attended by Royalty, Heads of State and large numbers of local, diplomatic and allied dignitaries.   His foresight, planning and coordination for these large scale events has always been excellent, but he is particularly commended for his part on the occasion of Her Majesty The Queen's visit in May 1978 and President Carter's visit the same year.
     In addition to all this he has managed to play a full part in community life, which has only been possible because of his strong sense of duty and exceptional diligence for which he is commended for special recognition.

Citation:  Sergeant Legge has been the Permanent Staff Instructor with 4 (Scottish) Port Task Force Provost Company, RMP, (TA) since 17 January 1956.   He joined the Company on the completion of his Regular Army engagement of  22 years at a tme when the unit strength of purely volunteer NCO was at a very low ebb.   By dint of hard work, perseverance and enthusiasm, Sergeant Legge was very largely responsible for putting the unit back on its feet and for giving it as strong sense of its importance in, first of all, the Beach Brigade and then, in 1957 the Port Task Force.   The present volunteer strength of 79% of the unit establishment reflects great credit on his efforts.
     In the early days of the unit's re-organization and rebuilding, when trained NCOs were few, Sergeant Legge found himself called upon to do every job in the unit, and, at the same time, to teach the TA NCO's to do these jobs themselves.   Proof of the high standard that he achieved in this task is given in the grading of ""Very Good"" that the unit has been given on its Annual Administrative Inspections in the last three years, and in the efficiency with which it carries out its duties.   As an Instructor has been excellent: no hours have been too long and no task too arduous and the loyalty he has given has been of the highest order.   
      The Territorial Army as a whole and his present unit in particular owe much to him for what has been no less than his whole-hearted devotion to the interests of the unit, and his unflagging an very successful efforts on its behalf.

While moving through very thick and difficult country, the armoured carrier section under this Officer's command suddenly became engaged at close quarters with a superior enemy force in position.   2nd Lt Birch, being temporarily cut off from the remainder of his section, sent his gunner to bring them up, and took over his gun.   Regardless of his personal safety, he stood up in his carrier and engaged the enemy over the top of the long grass.   Single handed, he held off his opponents, causing them heavy casualties, until he was put out of action by a direct his from a grenade and two revolver bullets.   The remainder of the section then arrived and put the enemy to flight.   By his quick decision, skill and bravery, 2nd Lt Birch turned what might have been a reverse with loss of valuable material into a victorious action.

Citation for DSO:   Throughout the operations between 23rd Oct and 4th Nov.   this Officer commanded his Squadron of Sherman Tanks with such skill and determination that for the loss of only one of his own tanks through enemy action he caused the destruction of the following enemy equipment as a minimum:  60 German Tanks (including 38 burnt out) 30 A/Tk guns (including a number of 88 & 76mm) and 12 lorries.   At day break on 24th Oct about 4000yards NE of El Wishka his Squadron was placed in the midst of enemy minefields with little room to manoeuvre, little cover from the ground, and faced with fire of several 88mm A/Tk guns.   Major Kaye watched each of the tanks in his Squadron and ordered them to move  individually as they were being ranged upon in turn.   At the same time he spotted each enemy gun or tank in action against him and by his excellent orders preserved his Squadron intact and gradually destroyed the enemy tanks and A/Tk guns.  Major Kaye repeated this type of action on many subsequent occasions and during all the close fighting in enemy minefields continually pressed his Squadron forward in support of our infantry.   One notable occasion of this was on the evening of 24th Oct. when he was able to get his Squadron through a recently cleared gap just in time to beat off an enemy tank counter-attack on 1 GORDONS about 4000 yards due North of El Wishka.   Major Kaye's determination, control of his Sqn and personal example of cool fearless efficiency were certainly a major factor in effecting a breakthrough of the enemy positions on the front of 1st Armd Division.

This Branch consists of some 50 officers, 450 other ranks and 250 native informers and trackers, who cover the whole of the Middle East.   During the first ten months of 1942 (1st. Jan - 31st .

The period under review has been one of exceptional difficulty for Lt. Col Whitehead.   The withdrawal of the 8th Army to the El Alamein line resulted in a vast body of troops and transport coming in or passing through the area, at the same time as reinforcement troops were moving westwards through the area.   The situation produced on the one hand grave traffic problems and on the other hand introduced into the area a large body of troops from many diverse units fresh from battle and in some cases disorganised.   The problems of both traffic and discipline presented many difficulties.   Lt. Col. Whitehead applied his untiring energy and his very intimate knowledge of his profession to the solution of these problems, and the success with which he dealt with them was of high importance both to this area and to Eighth Army.   At the same time the routine performance of his normal duties has given me has given me at all times the highest satisfaction.   I consider that his services, particularly during this difficult period, fully justify recognition.

This work was by no means confined to the Army only.   He has carried out all investigations for the Navy and RAF.   Further more he has rendered considerable assistance to U.S. Army on a number of occasions.   He has gained the confidence of the French Police without which it would have been impossible to have achieved such good results.   There can be no doubt that his work and the way  in which he has used his men has made the detection of crime more certain, and as this became known has had a considerable deterrent effect in decreasing such crime.  I recommend that this officer receives recognition by an award as shown or such other award as may seem appropriate for his able administration and unstinting work since his arrival in this theatre, which has, I consider, brought benefit to the whole force.

Much depended on the speed with which the great mass of transport, both fighting and adminisrative, could be got across the Merjarda and the very limited number of roads and tracks East of Medjez and the success with which this was achieved was largely due to Major Cairns.   It was also largely due to his tact and hard work that the difficult problem on controlling the large city of Tunis was effected so smoothly from the time of its capture.

On 13th July 1943 he was marking the route to be followed by the Brigade from CASSIBILE to FRANCOFONTE.   Shortly after passing through BUCCHRI he and his Corporal encountered two Italians who they made prisoners but almost immediately found themselves fired upon by two parties each of 6 or 7 men with several machine guns.   Several Italians rushed out to capture them but Lieut. Mackintosh interposed one of his prisoners between himself and the enemy.   The prisoner however attempted to expose Lieut. Macintosh to fire and had to be shot.   Meantime the Provost Corporal was wounded.   Lieut. Mackintosh scrambled away and covered the Corporal's withdrawl to his truck and then followed.   When the Advance Guard reached the scene of their encounter shorly afterwards, it was found that the enemy had bolted.   Lieut. Mackintosh showed great personal courage and it was due to his presence of mind and resoucefulness that neither he nor his Corporal was captured.   There is also no doubt that his bravery at this moment contributed to the hasty withdrawl of the enemy before the arrival of our Advance Guard.

Citation for the OBE:  As A.P.M., 13 Corps, Lt.Col FITZGERALD was responsible during the planning period for the provost arrangements on the Corps front and for putting them into execution when the invasion took place.   The planning was carried out by him with great efficiency and foresight and to such good effect that traffic control in SICILY was established from the outset on a thoroughly satisfactory basis.   Had this not been the case the success of the operations would have been seriously prejudiced.   Lt.Col FITZGERLAND was confronted with a difficult task:  to maintain a continuous flow of traffic along roads which were narrow and mountainous, often congested with refugees and obstructed at many points by enemy demolitions.   It was mainly due to his personality, leadership and drive that the Corps Provost Company kept the traffic in motion, working long hours under arduous conditions.   This outstanding work by Lt.Col FITZGERALD in SICILY is not an isolated example of the service which he has rendered.   Over a period of thirteen months covering operations in the Western Desert and Cyrenaica this officer has maintained the Corps Provost Company at a high level of efficiency and discipline, and has instilled into all ranks his own qualities of energy, courtesy and good humour.   Lt. Col FITZGERALD has carried out his duties with exceptional ability and has made a contribution of undoubted value to the successful  outcome of the recent operations.

During this period the Division was constantly on the move and had to fight their way across two rivers.   The nature of the country made the deployment of the Division extraordinarily difficult.   Throughout the whole of this period this officer was untiring in his efforts to maintain the flow of essential traffic.   On the night 5/6 Aug. 43, during the crossing of the River Salso this officer was constantly under shell fire, and it was largely due to his efforts that troops were got across the river before daylight.   Throughout the campaign in Sicily he has shown untiring energy and drive, and has carried out a very difficult task with great success.   His example has been an inspiration to all his men.

Two days later on the TREGLIO ridge (MR 3607 Lanciano) Lt. Wilson and his platoon beat off two enemy counter attacks and thus played an important part in holding the ground already won.

His able handling of the limited CMP Traffic Control resources under conditions never before experienced by this Army necessitated much careful thought and hard work on his part.  Many difficulties have been overcome chiefly on account of the personal touch Major Jones has maintained with the men throughout, often this necessitated his presence on the roads for long periods from 18 to 20 hours daily, frequently under very trying circumstances.   His vigilance has undoubtedly very largely assisted in the maintenance of the forward troops.   Major Jones by his enthusiasm and untiring efforts for Provost has made a great contribution towards the successful traffic arrangements so necessary in the move forward of the Eighth Army from Reggio to Ortona.

During this period the Eighth Army advanced rapidly through the toe and heel of ITALY to its final front on the ADRIATIC Coast, where it remained until early in Mar 1944 when regrouping on the Western Axis began in preparation for the Spring offensive.   The Provost problems during the advance up the East Coast;  during the static period on that front under bitter winter conditions, and later during the complicated regrouping of the Eighth Army on the Western Axis called for Provost work of the very highest order.   The high standard of efficiency maintained throughout all these operations by the Provost of the Eighth Army, and the ability with which the many difficult problems were tackled and overcome is due in large measure to the inspiration and capacity for organisation displayed by this officer, whose personal example at all times, his enthusiasm and untiring energy, and his loyal co-operation with all branches of the Staff and the Services of the Army, as well as with the Allied formations within the Army and those co-operating with the Army, both American and French, has set an example which is reflected throughout the Corps of Provost in the Eighth Army.

BARI is the centre of a highly organised and efficient Black Market, and the extensive layout of the military depots combined with the shortage of military guards has resulted in organised pilferage by civilian gangs on a very large scale.   Captain COOPER has tackled the problem energetically and with conspicuous success.   He has succeeded in breaking up the principal gangs engaged in the mail-bag, sugar and flour robberies, and the decline in organised pilferage is directly due to his tirelessness, efficiency and enthusiasm, while on several occasions he has displayed considerable courage when effecting single-handed the arrest of armed racketeers.   He has already recovered property amounting to nearly 12,400.

     Lieutenant Colonel Davies has held the key appointment in Berlin of Assistant Provost Marshal for nearly three years.   In addition to his normal Provost duties, Lieutenant Colonel Davies has been responsible for controlling and supervising all Royal Military Police patrols around the perimeter of the British Sector of Berlin and the Soviet War Memorial.
     In the event of an incident he has made it his duty whenever possible to be the first British officer to arrive on the scene.   As a result he has become known to the Soviet and East German officials as a recognised authority with whom they should deal.   Furthermore he accepts that once involved h cannot expect to be relieved, no mater how long the incident lasts since a change in the lever of representation might be interpreted as a change of policy.
     By his selfless enthusiasm, initiative and sound judgement, particularly in dealing with an incident, Lieutenant Colonel Davies has been able to make an exceptional contribution to the avoidance of tension in Berlin.   He has dealt closely with this Russian counterparts at the Soviet War Memorial and the Allied Check-points.   His opinion and experience is much respected by all members of the British Military Government and his is frequently used to clarify Soviet intentions and to deliver protest to them.   By his bluff good humour, tact and shrewd judgement, often under trying circumstances, he has achieved remarkable results.
     Throughout his tour he has worked in a very close harmony and co-operation with this French and American colleagues and they too regard him with respect and affection.

He landed on the SWORD Beaches on D Day and was responisible for the organisation and development of traffic control in the Port of OUISTREHAM and the BMA.

To him fell the task of organising the control of momement through CAEN, the imposition of restrictions of entry and exit, both civilian and military, and the maintenance of discipline in a town so severely damamged by bombing and shell fire that the temptations to looters were countless.   This entailed the early recce of his area of operations and frequent and rapid readjustments in the deployment of his limited resources.   Over 29 control points were at one time necessary in and around the town.   He maintained close liaison with the RE engaged on street clearance, with the Pro of 3 Cdn Div, 2 Cdn Corps, and with the civil authorities.

Capt CORBETT worked quietly and efficiently.   His execution of quick orders and new plans was beyond all praise.   He was largely responisible for the fact that at no time did the flow of refugees cause any embarrassment to the military operations.   For this quiet, efficient and cheerful example of leadership and resourcefulness under the most trying conditions I recommend him for the award of the MBE.

From that moment he was a tower of strength to the unit.   He was responsible for the traffic layout of the Assembly Area and for traffic control.   His men were all category men and it was entirely due to Lieut MULHEIR's actions that they did their job.   The conditions were very difficult.   The unit area was subject almost nightly to bombing attacks, and it was during this that, with disregard for his own safety, he travelled round to his men, staying with them on their points and encouraging them.   On the night of 9 June 44 there was a particularly bad attack with AP bombs and there were quite heavy casualties in one section of the Assembly Area.   Lieut MULHEIR immediately went to the spot and took command of the situation although he was by no means the senior officer present.   His action steadied the men and he supervised the evacuation of casualties.   On 12 June again he proceeded immediately to the scene of another attack and supervised the evacuation of casualties.   On 12 June 44 it was necessary to reorganise the area for the reception of 8 Corps.   This meant the re-signing of the area in a hurry as the unloading of the Corps was expected to begin at any time.   This re-signing was carried out by Lieut MULHEIR at night through further air raids until the task was finished.   Although the traffic circuits had to be changed, at no time was there any block in the flow of traffic.

His work at the various assault crossings of rivers which the Division has carried out has been invaluable and has ensured the smooth passage of the vehicles of the Division.   This work has necessitated daylight recces of the proposed crossing places whilst they were still in enemy hands, the planning of the various vehicle parks, traffic communications, the guiding of Sector Controls and TP's to the Bridge sites, and finally the continuous supervision of the traffic at the bridges, which naturally become the principal targets for enemy shell and mortar fire.

Citation:   Captain SCOTTIi has served continuously with 5 Canadian Provost Company from January 1943 and throughout his tour of command has performed his duties in a highly satisfactory manner.
     An energetic and tireless worker, Captain SCOTTI is well forward in actions organising and supervising the control of traffic.   Day or night in all kinds of weather, frequently under heavy artillery and mortar fire, this officer constantly visits his traffic posts to ensure a constant flow forward of supporting arms.
     On the night of 30 August 1944, Captain SCOTTI personally made a detailed reconnaissance of approach routes to the FOGLIA River for the GOTHIC LINE attack.   Not content with the information he obtained, he continued across the river and through a heavily mined area until he reached the MONBTECCHIO lateral.   As a result of this reconnaissance which was carried out under heavy mortar fire.   He formulated a sound traffic plan which contributed greatly to the success of the attack.
     The attack on CORIANO during the night 12/13 September 1944 followed two main axis of advance.   Both of the approaches and lateral road five hundred yards SOUTH of the town were under direct enemy observation.   Enemy minefield restricted movement on each road to one way traffic and this necessitated the strictest of traffic discipline and control, particularly in the early phases of the attack.   Captain SCOTTI sited two traffic control posts on the lateral road and throughout the attack personally maintained constant communication with the attacking Brigade headquarter and his traffic posts.   The outstanding coolness and rescurcefulness under fire displayed by this officer were an inspiration to all and the successful movement forward of supporting arms was due entirely to his planning and foresight.
    Under the brilliant leadership and organising ability of Captain SCOTTI, the company has reached such a high standard of efficiency that it has earned the esteem and respect of all ranks of the Division.

Citation for MBE:  By reason of initiative, leadership and organising ability of Major Wilfred George LLOYD, Assistant Provost Marshal, provost resources with Third Canadian Infantry Division have at all times met the exceedingly heavy demands placed upon them.   This has been most evident during periods of active operations when traffic control on operational routes and the handling of prisoners of war have stretched provost resources to their limit.   On every occasion involving a move of this formation, Major LLOYD has personally gone to the forward areas to ensure that traffic moved in accordance with the plan.   Many times under enemy shell fire, the presence of Major LLOYD, his coolness, fine soldierly example and ability to overcome obstacles, no matter how dangerous the situation, have been the main factor in keeping the traffic moving forward unimpeded.   As a disciplinarian Major LLOYD has imbued all ranks with the high standard which he himself has set.   The excellent standard of discipline, deportment and esprit de corps among provost personnel in this formation are the direct result of the insisitence at all times by Major LLOYD that all ranks not only do their job well but under any and all conditions.

His work during this period has been of an exceptionally high order.   Both in North Africa and in Italy he initiated and controlled with great success an organisation to defeat the extensive Black Market traffic which at the time was a considerable drain on W.D. resouces.   In both countries also he organised periodical drives against deserters, and due to his efforts many thousands were apprehended, and others deterred.   The sympathetic though firm attitude of the police under his command and guidance in the maintenance of discipline, and their smart appearance both on and off duty has earned the high respect of the rank and file for the Provost Service in the areas controlled by him.   Lieut-Colonel BLAIR has, by his loyal service and hard work, contributed materially, if indirectly, to the war effort, and I consider his services are deserving of the award of the O.B.E.

During that time he has been in control of the Provost arrangements for three mobile campaigns and one static campaign.   The control and policing of roads has been of the utmost importance in all these battle.   It is not too much to say that in the recent mobile operation in April 1945, the whole battle has turned on getting formations quickly over bridges and through diversions and defiles.   Under this officer's organisation and control the Provost of this Division have carried out their tasks by day and night, often under fire, with efficiency, enthusiasm and a great devotion to duty.   In the recent campaign, advancing up to 50 miles a day, enormous distances had to be covered and policed.   The arrangements made by this officer never failed and he invariably appeared himself at the most difficult or advanced place.   In all Provost matters his own example and enthusiasm has been as infectious to those under him as it has been sustained in himself.

Throughout this period the regiment has performed very successfully many difficult and hazardous tasks.   In particular, during operation ""IMACT"" they were called upon to support infantry over almost impossible country, and in the face of strong enemy opposition and A tk guns.   The tremendous support which was accorded on this occasion greatly assisted in the capture of the Div and Corps objectives, earning the greatest praise and credit from GOC 56 Div, Maj Gen J Y WHITFIELD, DSO, OBE.   Throughout all this period Lt Col KAYE by his determination, sound tactical knowledge and true devotion to duty was mainly responsible for his regiment achieving this success.   At all times Lt Col KAYE's presence with the leading troops in close contact with the enemy and under heavy fire instilled the maximum confidence in his men, and he was a magnificent example of courage and devotion to duty to all present.   Previously, during the period from the GOTHIC LINE up to the assault on R. SENIO, the 10th Hussars have except for a period of ten days, been continuosly in the line.   During all this period the regiment, under Lt Col KAYE's command, has carried out invaluable work in close support of many infantry units, whose commanders have all expressed their admiration and praise of this regiment.   The first class co-operation, skill and drive shown by Lt Col KAYE has been at all times and inspiration, and these factors are so largely responsible for the many successful actions in which this regiment has taken part.

Citation for OBE:  Lt-Col Godfrey-Faussett served with Headquarters 1 Corps throughout the campaign in North West Europe from 6 June 1944 until the 20 March 1945 as APM and from 20 March until the end of the campaign on 8 May 1945 as DPM.   He was responsible within 1 Corps for the provost planning for the assault and for organizing the assembly areas behind the beaches through which all troops following up the assault were to pass.   He himslef landed on D Day and immediatley took charge of all provost arrangements within the beachhead, working without sleep for over 72 hours.   That both units, individuals and vehicles, landing on a strange shore were able to find their way smoothly and without delay to their ultimate locations was very largely due to his powers of organization and to the complete control over the situation which he always possessed.   Later he organized with conspicuous success the traffic control arrangments for operation GOODWOOD, when three Armoured Divisions had to be passed at night on improvised tracks and roadways across the whole of the Corps front in the concentrated beach-head.   At the end of August for twenty four hours after the liberation of LISIEUX the great volume of traffic which had to pass through the bottleneck formed by this town produced a very serious problem.   Again owing to his quiet determination and ability the situation was controlled.   In September the traffic control for the move of the whole Corps from the area of LE HAVRE to BELGIUM required the most careful planning, and that the move was carried out smoothly is largely due to this officer's efforts.   Throughout the winter in HOLLAND the military police in 1 Corps under his direction maintained a consistently high standard.   This officer has throughout set a fine personal example and by his conscientiousness, enthusiasm and quiet ability has contributed in no small way to the ultimate success of operations.

Citation for the OBE:  This officer has been the Provost Staff Officer whose duty has been the maintenance of military discipline and good order throughout the Army during its progress from the Beaches to the Baltic.   Owing to the disorganisation or absence of Civil Police forces in liberated and enemy countries, there has been added the further grave responsibility for preventing disorder among the civil population, and recently in Germany, ensuring obedience and good behavious under Milittary Government Law.   His imperturbability under exacting conditions and powers of organisation of the highest order caused a large number of suspected persons, including some war criminals, to be apprehended and an enormous displaced population to be controlled and prevented from continual looting and riot.   At one time the stealing and improper possession of WD stores in liberated countries gave cause for anxiety.   By his capapcity for careful though and hard work the larceny of petrol and rations was almost entirely stopped and Government property of enormous value was recovered for use in operations.

Since that date he has commanded his section with conspicuous success.   At a time when loss of petrol was becoming a matter for grave anxiety, his efforts were largely directed to the prevention of large scale stealing from depots and particularly from the pipeline.   This officer, by his brilliant leadership of his section succeeded in breaking the largest black market gang in FRANCE, thereby not only saving many thousands of pounds worth of goods but also recovering vast quantities of govermnment property which were urgently required.   His name is a byword in NORMANDY.   In spite of an almost overwhelming amount of work, with his section split over a wide area, never once did Capt JONES show himself unable to assist formation staffs in any new problems, however small.   His ready coopertion, his unfaliling cheerfulness, his persistence, and the unassuming manner with which he shouldered the most complex problems, have revealed an officer of great distinction and high merit.   His unswerving devotion to duty has been an inspiration to all with whom he came into contact.

Maj LAXTON has been APM of 20 Indian Div since April 1942 when the division was raised, and has done a first class job of work throughout, during the preliminary organisation period, during the training period in CEYLON and since October 1943 in the operational area in ASSAM  and BURMA.   For the last six months he has most successfully organised the traffic control and provost duties on a very long stretch of road from PALEL to TAMU and beyond, and when the Japanese advanced in March 1944, the smooth and effective evacuation of a very great number of engineer and pioneer personnel and of a mass of stores and equipment was made possible by his untiring devotion to duty, ceaseless energy, and personal initiative.   In the latter stages of the withdrawal from MOOREH and other areas on the TAMU - PALEL road, the road was frequently shelled, mortared and sniped by parties of enemy infiltrating on the sides of the roads.   Completely regardless of his own safety at all times he was always where he was most wanted, marshalling vehicles, clearing blocks of traffic, inspecting his many and scattered control posts, and encouraging the men at them, until on the 31st March 1944 he was wounded by a shell which pitched on the road near him while he was marshalling vehicles.   Though suffering from several severe wounds, he organised the evacuation of others wounded in the area by the same shelling, and did not go to hospital until his work for the day was completed.   His devotion to duty throughout the period from April 1942 to March 1944 has been deserving of the highest praise and has contributed largely to the smoothness and security with which the many moves of the Division during this period have been carried out.

He has had on innumerable occasions to assume the responsibilities of an officer and at all times his courage and determination have been of the highest order.   In the midst of the appalling conditions during the operations in the ARDENNES he showed the greatest skill and endurance in handling traffic problems and he personally carried out many of the forward reconnaissances of routes which were required, under frequent enemy fire and with complete disregard for mines hidden by snow.   On the occasion of the RHINE crossing he was responsible for lighting several of the routes from the assembly areas to the river bank.   Under heavy fire he carried this out personally, checking and re-checking that the work was done meticulously and in accordance with his previous reconnaissances.   He encountered an enemy patrol which speedily dispersed, and despite many hazards the task was completed on schedule.   Throughout the sustained pursuit battle which followed he worked unceasingly day and night in the forefront of the Division dealing with the many traffic problems and making routes for the forward troops.   This WO has given quite outstanding service in the campaign.   His personal bravery and determination are beyond praise and his devotion to duty is of the highest order.

Citation for Belgian Chevalier of the Order of Leopold II with Palm & Croix De Guerre 1940 with Palm:  In October 1944 during the course of operations to open the ports of GHENT and ANTWERP to Allied shipping 52nd (L) Division was committed to a two-pronged assault of the SCHELDT islands of WALCHEREN and BEVELAND.   One arm of this assault entailed sea crossings white the other was dependent solely on a single road axis of very limited capabilities.   The success of the operation may largely be attributed to sound planning, co-ordination and supervision of the very complex traffic problems involved.   Major WREN, as APM of the Division upon whom the satisfactory solution of the very complicated traffic problems so largely depended, was indefatigable in surmounting all difficulties.   his planning was sound and efficient;  he obtained the best results from his subordinates by the high standard of example which he set;  and he was constantly to be found in forward areas of considerable danger, personally supervising the avoidance and clearance of traffic bottlenecks.   As the battle progressed, Major WREN was faced with the further problem of dealing with the evacuation of large numbers of enemy prisoners of war amounting to a total of over ten thousand.   The presence of so many enemy prisoners of war in the forward areas might have proved of considerable embarrassment to the forward units had Major WREN not so efficiently organised their rapid evacuation despite the limited resources available.

On arrival he saw the fins of the bomb protruding from the ground and personally withdrew the bomb and removed it to a safe place, thus allowing the traffic on the route to resume.

During the withdrawal from the River Escaut, this NCO reconnoitered in advance the oil refineries at Willems, waited until the whole of the rearguard, 3rd Infantry Brigade, had passed, so as not to risk interfering in any way with their movement, and, with complete disregard for his own safety, successfully fired the large stocks of oil there.

Col. has been Deputy to the Provost Marshal at HQ AAI and AFHQ for approximately twelve months, and acted for the Provost Marshal for a month in the Spring when the latter was away from the theatre.   He has worked with untiring loyalty and enthusiasm for the good of the Provost Service, and has been entirely responsible for the Staff duties and organisation side of the Section.   The fact that the CMP was kept up to strength during the period of active operations when the manpower situation was acute, was very largely due to his personal energy and initiative in contacting officers commanding Battalion's and reinforcement Depots.   By reason of the cheerful and efficient manner in which he has performed a rather dull and unspectacular task, he has obtained the co-operation of those with whom he has had to deal, which has contributed very largely to the smooth running of the Provost Service throughout the theatre.

He has also been responsible for the security and routing arrangements of many distinguished British visitors to the HQ during the period, when his Provost arrangements were extremely satisfactory.   He has shown extreme tact and zeal in the performance of his duties, especially in co-operating with his American counterpart.   As a Provost Officer, he has shown an extremely high sense of duty and set an example in his bearing and conduct to all ranks.

Joining the Division in the ANZIO  Beachhead he soon showed that he had exceptional qualities and powers of organisation.   These powers he has used to the full throughout his service with the Division in ITALY and GERMANY and his efforts have time and again deserved the highest praise.   In the moves which the Division undertook from Italy, both in and out of action and until the final stages of the war in North West Europe when it crossed the River ELBE, Major ALEXANDER's superb traffic arrangements were invaluable.   By his personal endeavour and unflagging energy he was an example to the whole Divisional Provost Company and to all others with whom he came in contact.   In the maintenance of discipline as APM, Major ALEXANDER has been a tower of strength, and his traffic organisation has been a very material factor in the Division's success during its operations.

The high standard of discipline and leadership set by Capt BENNETT is abundantly shown in the very efficient duties carried out by the Div Pro Coy both during active operations and during the extended approach movements preceding them.   Capt BENNETT is quite untiring and completely disregards his personal safety in his efforts to ensure that operational and maintenance routes are clearly marked and controlled right up to the rear of the forward troops.   The battles of CAMINO, GARIGLIANO, ANZIO and the recent operations in the GOTHIC Line have all presented great traffic difficulties.   These were smoothed out almost entirely by the continual reconnaissance and quick decisions of Capt BENNETT.   Such operations must be largely dependent on traffic organisation and in the Divisional sector the untiring efforts of Capt BENNETT were a major contribution to the successful results achieved.

Citation for MBE:  As Officer Commanding 77 Section Special Investigation Branch of the CMP, Captain DAWSON is responsible for all criminal inquiries throughout the Eighth Army.   For the period 1 Sept 31 Dec 44 and previously throughout the spring offensive in Italy from the Gustav Line onwards, this officer has conducted a very considerable number of highly intricate and involved investigations, bringing many of them finally to a successful conclusion.   His prowess as a criminal investigator in the field is outstanding, particularly in view of the difficult and often hazardous nature of the work and the almost complete lack of the normal scientific aids to police investigation.   On 10 Nov 44, FORLI fell to the Eighth Army and Captain DAWSON entered the town with a small detachment.   Information had been received that the enemy had committed atrocities on a large scale in the form of mass executions.   Although investigation of War Crimes is outside the normal scope of his duties, Captain DAWSON undertook immediate inquiries.   His work on FORLI airfield, carrious out with relentless tenacity under the most nauseating and appalling conditions made a great impression on the civilian population, to the general benefit of British Military Administration.   By his acumen, the application and thoughtful employment of his men, and above all by his own personal untiring example, he has not only brought a great number of military and civilian delinquents to justice, but has overcome the great administrative difficulties affecting his small unit that might well have nullified many of his Section's efforts.   The success that has attended the work of his men, has in a very large measure, been due to his own encouragment, leadership, wisdom and guidance.

The battles which the Corps fought during this period depended very largely on the successful control of an immense volume of traffic.   Lt-Col INNES was responsible for this control and his success was conspicuous.   It was achieved only by the most marked devotion to duty and assumption of authority and responsibility not normally expected of an APM.  In addition, he worked himself to a state of exhaustion and continually placed himself in positions of danger far forward in the battle area.

The vital task of Indian police patrol on the Divisional maintenance track from CERVARO to CAIRO, and on the ambulance track from PORT LYA to HIGHWAY 6.   He had orders to take particulars of vehicles knocked out by shell-fire, to assist drivers pass shelled areas and to police ambulances so that priority against the various traffic circuits would get wounded men back to the M.D.S. in quick time.   He preferred to tackle the job alone in his Jeep and for two days and nights, his untiring efforts and personal energy under constant enemy shell-fire, and in appalling weather conditions, undoubtedly assisted the forward movement of food and ammunition, and rearward movement of wounded soldiers from the line.
On the 7th February, during this patrol, a Jeep was knocked out by a shell about fifty yards in front of him near VILLA, and whilst on the way to give assistance to the British soldiers in the blazing Jeep, was himself seriously wounded.
Havildar Sher Khan, although twice wounded in battles of the Western Desert showed a complete disregard for his personal safety, and was an inspiration to the Indian soldiers of the unit who regard him as a worthy battle veteran.

His duty was to ensure the forward flow of traffic, which could only move under cover of darkness, in preparation for the assault crossing of the R. Sangro.   Lieut. Rowe with 2 secs of 101 Pro Coy under command, carried out all duties with outstanding efficiency from 20 Nov until 3 Dec 43 when relieved.   During first four days of this period Lt. Rowe was constantly on duty on roads which were being shelled by enemy artillery.   Vehicles hit and set on fire on one occasion, were cleared under supervision of this officer.   As a result of his continual alertness, all traffic was given necessary protection from enemy observation on the forward slopes approaching SANGRO River, thereby saving life and valuable equiment from certain destruction by enemy fire.   At all times Lt. Rowe was outstanding in courage and initiative, under the most difficult circumstances, and his work was a material contributory factor to the success of crossing the SANGRO River.   Since being relieved  of above duties Lt. Rowe has been in charge of PROVOST, LANCIANO, M.R. Sq 320-3.   In this busy town during advance, this officer has been an example to all ranks, and his efficiency, cheerfulness and devotion to duty are beyond all praise.

Citation for Bronze Star Medal:  RICHARD CHARLES LOUIS LIMBERT, 291650, Captain, General List, British Army, for meritorious achievement in connection with military operations against the enemy in Italy from February to December 1944.   Captain Limbert, as an experienced police officer, was placed in charge of the evacuation, care and organization of the masses of refugees pouring through communes newly liberated by the United States Fifth Army.   First at Sessa Arunea, where he cared for 7,000 refugees in the refugee centre established there, and later at Venafro, Captain Limbert set up and supervised a chain of refugee posts which served to clear strategic highways and road networks of refugee traffic.   His cool courage in the face of danger several times acted to prevent serious disturbances among the distraught civilians, as in the case of the bombing of Venafro, where Captain Limbert assisted in calming 300 panic stricken refugees.   Refugee centres also were set up at Ausonia, Lenola, Vetralla, Ponsacco and other small towns.   Following the liberation of Florence, Captain Limbert opened a refugee centre, the largest attempted on the Italian mainland, where 16,000 refugees were cared for.   Processing as many as 4,900 refugees a day, Captain Limbert opened a hospital to care for the sick, a school for the children and a nursery for babies, as well as a dis-infector, shower bath, club room, theatre, and other facilities to solve rehabilitation and occupation problems of the refugees.   His outstanding services are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself and the Allied Nations.

Citation:   Captain STEAD joined the Army in 1936 and his outstanding ability and devotion to duty quickly earned him promotion.   He transferred to the CMP in 1938.   He later saw active service in both World War II and KOREA when his personal example and leadership was of the highest order.
     In 1958 he became the PSO fo 42 Division Provost Company since when his high standards of devotion to duty have been reflected in every activity of the unit.
     He is a tremendously popular man yet one to be feared by the idle and incompetent.   He is intensely loyal to his unit and its members and never spares himself in his efforts on their behalf.   Indeed his devotion to duty and reliability far exceed that which is required or expected of him by regulations, and he and the unit he serves have become a byword throughout the 42nd Division.
     He identifies himself very closely with the units in the Division and District and plays a most important part in coordinating their Provost arrangements.
     Without doubt Captain STEAD is an outstanding example to inspiration to all who work with him and know him.   His long and devoted service well merits recognition and I strongly recommend that he be awarded the MBE.

Citation for BEM:  CQMS Stewart joined this unit on 3rd May 1948 and has been unfailing in his attendance both at Camps and normal bi-weekly drills since this date.   This unit does not carry a regular CQMS on the staff and therefore the Administration from the ""Q"" point of view would be extremely difficult if I was not fortunate in having the services of CQMS Stewart at my disposal.   He puts in long hours in excess of normal drills in order to keep abreast of the growing volume of work in his department caused by a steady increase of volunteers over the years and a proportionate greater increase of late months due to the arrival of National Service Men.   At the Annual and Week-end Camps he has attended (and he has never missed one yet) I can count on his deparment functioning perfectly.   The ""Q"" side of any unit is perhaps the least glamourous and provided much routine work of an uninteresting nature but unless this be done satisfactorily and indeed with enthusiasm the unit will never be an efficient one.   CQMS Stewart is utterly reialble and his keeness is a byword in the unit.   I therefore have much pleasure in recommending him for the award of the BEM and trust that most urgent and sympathetic consideration be given to this recommendation.

During this period his work was of the highest order which was inspired by his intense devotion to duty.   He was appointed DAPM, HQ 3 District on 23 Oct 44.   His appointment coincided with a considerable increase in administrative responsibilities of the Provost branch, the burden of which additional duties was borne by him.   The high degree of enthusiasm, zeal and efficiency which he displayed was much more than might be expected from him in the normal course of his duty.   Largely as a result of his efforts it was possible to surmount the most difficult obstacles, many of them of a delicate nature, and thus avoid any hitch in administrative machinery during what may be considered a very difficult period..

This officer took over command of the company in February 1945, having previously been 2 I/c.   At all times he has kept the men under his command at the highest pitch of efficiency, by his energy, enthusiasm and example.   During the move from the mountains to the Po Valley and again from the Senio River to Trieste, it was due to his untiring work and efficient organisation that a smooth flow of traffic was ensured and that the moves were completed quickly and with complete success.   His untiring energy, cheerfulness and devotion to duty has been an inspiration to the success of the provost work at all times.

4366,3649," CMP D & TE OTTAVIANO, ITALY. ",5,37274,4673,1945-09-18,"Italy.   MBE citation:   This Officer assumed command of the CMP Depot & TE (Training Establishment). At OTTAVIANO in March 1944, shortly after the Unit's arrival from NORTH AFRICA.   The training capacity of this Unit was then 120 and the accommodation available both dilapidated and inadequate.   By his personal enthusiasm and initiative and in the face of very considerable administrative difficulties Major PRICE has now produced a first class Establishment with a present feeding strength of 1,000.   This is the only permanent Police School in CMF and trains British, Canadian, South African, Indian, Polish and Italian Military Police in all branches of Police work including Criminal Investigation, and has dealt with approximately 2,664 students and probationers in the last 12 months.   The machinery to deal with such a number of students and to produce such a high standard of training is entirely due to the outstanding efforts of the Commandant and is largely responsible for the high standard of efficiency of CMP personnel in the Theatre and for the excellent spirit of co-operation and friendship which exists between UK, Dominion and Allied Police.

This officer arranged and established, with a small organization of men of the A.M.P.C., the main traffic control post at LANDIVISEAU for the forward advance of the Canadian Division from Brest and the subsequent evacuation.   This was no easy task and if it had not been efficiently organized and supervised the main road would have been hopelessly blocked and the evacuation of personnel could not have been carried out successfully.   His tactful and untiring effort both with the French civilians and the troops in transit, made a success of this part of the evacuation.

MBE Citation:   During the period Oct 44 to Feb 45 armed highway and other violent robberies affecting Allied interests and attributable to gangs of deserters and civilian desperadoes were rife in Southern Italy.   These gangs, highly organised along professional lines, terrorised the civilian population in many areas.   They were well armed, equipped with a variety of stolen transport and in addition had the advantage of a good local intelligence system.  Lt. FINNEY with the squad under his command were instrumental in breaking up and arresting these gangs finally resulting in the virtual disappearance for this type of crime.  This success entailed unremitting hard work, detailed investigation and the exercise of initiative and considerable daring.   He performed very dangerous duties in arresting many criminals whose usual mode of resistance was small arms fire at close quarters.   Lt FINNEY'S leadership on the occasions when these armed men were brought to justice during this period showed outstanding gallantry and conspicuous devotion to duty.

4369,3652,APM 1Corps District,30,38079,4520,1947-09-25,"France,Belgium.   Citation for the Belgian Order of Leopold II with Palm and Croix de Guerre 1940 with Palm.  Major (then Capt) Stirling landed in Normandy on D + 3 in command of 16 Coy CMP (TC).   He was responsible for much of the early organisation of the very heavy TC in the Second Army railhead area round BAYEUX.   Working with the minimum of police he was very successful in producing better order out of the terrific congestion resultant on the early operational phase.   As the battle moved on, his area of responsibility and the police under his command increased until he was controlling traffic over 2,400 sq miles of Normandy, including the vital roots of the L of C tree.   Though his work was mainly TC, much Provost work, anti-looting etc, also came his way and was most faithfully perfomed, both then and later in Belgium.   At the end of 1944 Capt Stirling was transferred to TOURNAI in Belgium, and he remained there for four months, controlling L of C traffic and the incoming Divisions from Italy in a large area of Belgium.   From there he went th GHENT for a month on the same type of work.   In both cases a great deal of organising and putting existing improvisations onto a permenant footing was required, and this was achieved with marked success.   During the ten months he worked in France and Belgium, Capt Stirling's work was not spectacular but was very heavy and of great value;  always performed and carried out with perseverance and devotion to duty, and crowned with real success.

During the whole of this period he has earned and unfailingly held, the loyalty and support of the Unit Staff by his personal example of rigid discipline coupled with scrupulous fairness shown at all times.   Moreover, the qualities of RSM Davies were also acknowledged by the majority of the soldiers under sentence who respected rather than feared him.   His advice and guidance given, particularly to many men who found themselves in Detention for the first time in their Army careers, and his ability to differentiate between various types and characters has contributed in a very large measure towards the soldiers under sentence, earning a suspension of Sentence in the shortest possible time and his consequent rehabilitation to a more usefull role in operational and service Units.
This valuable service has resulted from RSM Davies' unflagging zeal and outstanding devotion to duty.

Citation:  During his tour of duty as a Quartermaster Sergeant of 101 Provost Company, his first such appointment, SSGT HARE has been faced with a considerable number of extremely demanding and challenging tasks, far beyond the degree of difficulty normally associated with this type of post in the Corps of Royal Military Police.  He has had to cope with these without the help of a unit Quartermaster, against non-negotiable deadlines and despite the death of his daughter and consequent family problems.   In summary he has had to deal successfully with a situation which would have deterred all but the most resolute and determined of characters.
     For example in addition to his sole, responsibility for the day to-day management of three companies' vehicles, stores, accommodation and equipment, 101 and 102 Companies and the WRAC Provost BAOR increment, SSGT HARE has had to plan, organise and supervise the logistic aspects of the amalgamation of two units and concentration of a third from several widely dispersed locations.   He has had to do so without any cessation in the busy round of normal business or deterioration in the support demanded for police operations and major exercises such as CRUSADER and the preparation for LIONHEART.
     SSGT HARE has set and maintained the highest standards successfully meeting every requirement placed upon him by a combination of exceptional professional efficiency and selfless personal dedication.   His performance of his duties has been consistently in the highest traditions of the Service, an example to all with whom he has come into contact, and the results that he has produced far better than might be reasonable expected from the majority of more experienced senior not commissioned officers.   He has made a most significant contribution to the work of his Corps in BAOR and his efforts are deserving of official recognition.

Citation:  Since August 1981 Corporal Terry has been employed in the Police Officer of 113 Provost Company.   Since August 1983 she has run this office in its entirety and has assumed the awesome responsibility associated with this demanding task.   The job is normally given to a senior Sergeant or Staff Sergeant with many years of police experience.   Because of her familiarity with the office Corporal Terry was asked to step in for a short period and to fill the post.   She immediately took command of the situation and began to improve on the coordination of the Company's police effort by developing the system of controlling and processing case files.   her painstaking attention to detail immediately improved the quality and production of police reports.   She has used her initiative and creative flair to initiate a system of strict control over sensitive documents and has saved much time and effort of hard pressed investigators.   The improvements in standards have included the maintenance of statistics and the organisation of archives to achieve quick retrieval of information.   All are a direct result of Corporal Terry's hard work and diligence.  She has uncomplainingly devoted many hours of her precious spare time, both at night and during weekends to attain this remarkable achievement.
     In addition, as a policewoman, Corporal Terry has volunteered to carry out interviews in connection with delicate cases involving children where tact and sensitivity have been required.   These investigations have often been distasteful yet she readily accepts these distressing demands when she could well remain at her desk.
     Corporal Terry is a Queen's Guide and despite the excessive demands of her extremely responsible job and her marriage to a policeman she still finds time to assist in the running of a Girl Guide Troop.   This time consuming extra mural activity is yet another fine example of her dedication to others.   Corporal Terry is also an accomplished soldier who is an inspiration to her juniors, peers and indeed her seniors.   She has earned their support and respect.   She deserves more.   Her unfailing devotion to duty, her achievements and her special dedication to her part in society should be rewarded by public recognition.

     11/6/1940 captured ST VALERY EN CAUX - On 11 Jun 1940 while serving with the 51 Div, CMP at ST VALERY EN CAUX, I was captured on the beach.   I was perfunctorily searched, but was never interrogated.   next day we were marches eastwards.   We passed through DOULLENS, ST POL, BETHUNE and LA BASSEE.   On 28 Jun 40 I escaped from the Line of March near ILLIES with Cpl, CARTER, CMP (S/P (F) 558) and L/Cpl FRYER, FSP., (S/Pg (F) 301).   We obtained help from a family in ILLIES, who gave us food and civilian clothes and later an old farmer gave us more food and 200 francs, and hid us in his ""shooting box"" near HERLIES.   We then decided to separate, as it was too dangerous to be seen together.
     At end of Jul 40 I set out for CROIX, S E of ROUBAIX, where I had some friends.   When I got to LOOS, I was befriended by an Englishman, who had served in the last war, and had married a French wife.   He introduced me t a Frenchman who was an official of the fire brigade for another town in northern France.   in consequence I went to this town, and was enrolled as a member of the Fire Brigade.   I could speak very little French, but I stayed here for two months, and the other firemen treated mw with the greatest kindness.   The Germans made the Firemen wear armbands with the Eagle and Swastika over their French uniforms.   I used to wear this also, as I could not with safety do otherwise.   I likewise received a special identity card from the German authorities.   In Sept some Gestapo men came to the town, and sometimes made use of the Fire Brigade barracks.   My friends therefore thought it better for me to move elsewhere.
     On 20 Sept 40 I went to RADINGHEM and CROIX near ARMENTIERES.   For four months I lived by turns in this place and CROIX.   I had friends in both places, and it was thought safer for me to alternate between them.
     In Jan 41 I went to SECLIN near LILLE.   Here I got some helpers who gave me false papers and arranged by journey to MARSEILLES, where I arrived on 9 Feb 41.   I lived in a lodging house here for about three weeks when I was sent into internment at St HIPPOLYTE DU FORT, near NIMES..
     On 3 Mar 41 I escaped from St HIPPOLITE with two other British PW named William THOMAS and Robert BROWN (not the Brown referred to in S/PC (F) 601).   We got out of the Camp very early in the morning, and made our way to MARSWEILLES, whence we hoped to reach SPAIN.   Here I met a Frenchman who gave us some money, took us to a railway station, and bought us three tickets so PERPIGNAN.   We arrived there at about 0400 hrs on 5 Mar 41, and waled to LWE BOULOU, about 9 miles North of the Franco-Spanish frontier.   We slept in a Workman's hut in some waste ground.   Later we went into the village.   In our innocence we thought we could secure a guide into SPAIN for 50 FRS, and as our French was very bad, out attempt to dos so made us very conspicuous.   We were accordingly arrested by the police.
     On 6 Mar 41 we were taken to CERET, and remanded for 37 days in prison in PERPIGNAN.   Later, we were sentenced to one years imprisonment and a fine of 1000 francs for being in possession of false papers.   We appealed against this sentence.   On 2 May 41 we were transferred to a prison in MONTPELLIER .   On 6 Jun 41 our appeal was heard,   The US consul at MARSEILLES paid the expenses of the advocate.   On 4 Oct 41 we were released and returned to our advocate.   On 4 Oct 41 we were released and returned to ST HIPPOLYTE DU FORT,   The remainder of our sentence was annulled.
     From this point my experiences are described in Pte. INGLIS' Report (S/PC (F) 1076).

He has had on innumerable occasions to assume the responsibilities of an officer and at all times his courage and determination have been of the highest order.   In the midst of the appalling conditions during the operations in the ARDENNES he showed the greatest skill and endurance in handling traffic problems and he personally carried out many of the forward reconnaissances of routes which were required, under frequent enemy fire and with complete disregard for mines hidden by snow.   On the occasion of the RHINE crossing he was responsible for lighting several of the routes from the assembly areas to the river bank.   Under heavy fire he carried this out personally, checking and re-checking that the work was done meticulously and in accordance with his previous reconnaissances.   He encountered an enemy patrol which speedily dispersed, and despite many hazards the task was completed on schedule.   Throughout the sustained pursuit battle which followed he worked unceasingly day and night in the forefront of the Division dealing with the many traffic problems and making routes for the forward troops.   This WO has given quite outstanding service in the campaign.   His personal bravery and determination are beyond praise and his devotion to duty is of the highest order.

Citation for BEM:  During the period Sept - Dec 44 8 Ind Div Provost Coy has been operating under the most adverse conditions of weather in the Apennines.   Mountainous and narrow roads have necessitated detachments of the Coy being widely separated making the problem of supply and administration an exceedingly difficult one.   Throughout the whole period CQMS DENYER has never spared himself in carrying out his duties with the greatest efficiency and enthusiasm.   He has constantly undertaken the long and difficult journeys often at nigh necessary to bring up stores to all detacments over some of the worst roads the Division has encoutered.   His task has been further complicated  by the fact that the Provost Coy consists of British and Mixed Indian personnel of different castes.   But in spite of these difficulties CQMS DENYER has by his untiring efforts ensured the regular arrival of all rations and necessary replacements of clothing and equimpment.

River Rapido, Italy
During the initial stages of the river crossing of the RAPIDO on 11/12 May 1944 the above named NCO was in charge of CMP in the forward sector of 28 Infantry Brigade.   When the crossing failed, heavy shelling and mortaring occurred and this NCO showed  great courage and bravery not only in keeping his own section of men together but also all other personnel in the vicinity.   One Traffic Control Post under his control failed to report in after all other TP's had left the area and the river crossing and he went forward through heavy mortar fire to locate them.   During the morning of 12 May he also volunteered to go forward to attempt to recover vehicles which had been sent forward to raft the river and had been held up with shell and mortar fire.   Although he was unable to recover the vehicles he cleared the area of troops, searching very diligently for wounded in spite of being in view of the enemy.   During the ensuing days of 13,14 and 15 May this NCO was forward on the bridges the whole time, and by his courage and personal disregard for safety kept his section together when under mortar and shellfire.

Citation for CBE: As the only remaining officer of his rank and status who has an all round knowledge of Provost work during the War and since, he has done an immense amount for the Corps of Royal Military Police and towards its contribution to the Army.   In his combined roles of AAG and Deputy Provost Marshal, he has subordinated his many outside interests far outside normal hours in order to pass on his knowledge and ideas to others.   He has already held a Colonel's appointment in the Far East and was recommended recently to hold a Provost appointment (which later fell through) in the rank of Colonel.   His selfless influence, espirit de corps and unbounded enthusiasm have been a major contribution to the efficiency and standards of the Royal Military Police to which Corps no greater pleasure could be given than that special recognition should be bestowed on him on the occasion of his retirment in June this year.

During this time he has been responsible for the safe passage in the District of many very important personages, all of which has been accomplished with the minimum fuss and maximum efficiency.   Furthermore, he has organised and planned measures for combating the dangerous armed gangs of deserters who were holding up and robbing civilians in the District.   Due to his careful and well thought out instructions the gangs have been broken up and the menace settled.   Lt Col McNALLY constantly tries new methods for improving discipline, both MT and personal, by using the very slender resouces in Provost Coys in the District to their very best advantage.   His excellent example to all Provost personnel has raised the standard of all ranks to a very high pitch of efficiency.   I strongly recommend him for the award of OBE.

Citation:   On the night of 16/17th November 1952 Sgt GAIT was in command of a patrol on the feature known as RONSON.   He inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy with his own weapons and then when that sure that there were sufficient numbers to justify it, he called down artillery fire when his own patrol suffered five casualties from an enemy shell and he himself was badly shaken by blast, he remained calm and efficient, requested assistance by wireless and rendered first aid to his men.
     Early in the battle of the 18/19th on the HOOK, Sgt GAIT's Platoon Commander became a casualty.   Very soon after taking over command GAIT was ordered to carry out an immediate counter attack, to clear the enemy from the feature, as soon as out own artillery fire lifted.   He swept forward with his men through heavy enemy shell and mortar fire, killing and chasing the enemy till he reached the line of the lateral trench across the HOOK.   Here his me were pinned down by fire from several LMG's and showers of grenades, from the high ground in the vicinity of the artillery Observation post GAIT without thought for his own safety proceeded to organise the defence of the ground retaken.   He got in touch with a neighbouring Platoon Commander and coordinated their actions by intelligent anticipation of enemy outflanking attacks, he was able to stabalise the situation.
     Later in the night, he and his remaining men succeeded in preventing the third enemy attack from penetrating the trench line, and single handed beat off one enemy probe which came round the flank.
     Throughout the battle and on every previous occasion when in close contact with the enemy Sgt GAIT has shown himself to be fearless, inspiring and highly efficient leader.   Officers and men have the greatest admiration for the outstanding qualities of this fine young energetic man.

Citation:   Over the 6 months period covered by this citation S/Sgt Bottomley was the commander of the Ambassador's close protection team.   This coincided with a tense and dangerous period when the city of Beirut was once again split by fighting, taken over by rival militias and subjected to sporadic shelling.   There were armed hold-ups, kidnappings and assassinations.   The team was called upon to show decisiveness, sound judgement, tact, restraint and good humour;  and to acquire information from and develop relations with militiamen of dubious reliability - all this in addition to the maintenance of their high professional standards and fitness.   S/Sgt Bottomley led his team with a distinctive blend of firmness good humour and personal professional excellence.
   In particular he should be commended for his determination, courage, resourcefulness and good judgement on 6 Feb when he led a team of 3 from the Embassy through gathering disorder on the streets to the Ambassador's residence which was at risk from militiamen.   These shot out the TV monitor at the gate and dragged off the official Rangerover at gunpoint;  but were deterred by S/Sgt Bottomley's firm handling of the situation from invading the residence itself.   After a night of shelling during which the team maintained calm at the residence and prevented any inroads by militiamen they brought the Ambassador's wife on the following day to the comparative safety of the Embassy officers.

Citation:    S/Sgt RAYNER has been employed as the RMP Police Adviser at NITAT (BAOR) since January 1982.
     His job involves teaching and advising all units on the following subjects - Legal Aspects, including all forms of arrest, Evidence Handling, Preservation of Scenes of Crime, Op Logging Exercise and liaison with the RUC and RMP Pointer Teams.   In addition,m he acts as the Chief Clerk for NITAT's TAC  Wing and is involved in updating the incident and map boards.   he has proved to be a most conscientious worker, who is prepared to work very long unsocial hours to ensure that units are fully prepared for their operational tours in Northern Ireland.   Without doubt, his enthusiasm, tact and skills in putting across a very difficult subject, ensures that all ranks are fully conversant with the law and the problems of RUC liaison.   Every Commanding Officer has stated that without S/Sgt RAYNER's expert advice, individuals would have had many legal problems during their tour.   On his own initiative, S/Sgt RAYNER introduced an OP logging and reporting exercise, which involves every soldier going to Ireland.   This has had a tremendous benefit in Northern Ireland, as now every soldier is confident in logging correct details of sightings, movement and any abnormalities that occur.   This has aided the intelligence staff who use these reports to corroborate various reports from other agencies.   Again on his own initiative, he organised supporting legal lectures for students who are taught at NITAT's Search Training Wing.   This was not previously done.   He also ensured that all instructors in every NITAT department are aware of all the legal difficulties so that no false lessons are taught by them.   Above all else, he is a loyal dedicated and a soldier of the highest standing.   He leaves the Army in October 19784 and recognition of his service would be richly deserved.

     Major Collins is dedicated to his job for seven days in the week and rarely takes time off.   he has created a highly efficient and effective organisation with the minimum of manpower resources by making efforts far beyond those required to fill the post.

OC 113 Provost Company, RMP.  BAOR Close Protection Officer.   August 1982 - May 1984.
Citation:    In addition to his normal duties as officer Commanding, Major Townsend has been the BAOR Close Protection Officer from August 1982 to May 1984.   This has entailed the detailed -planning, preparation and execution of armed operations to ensure the personal safety of members of the Royal Family, the Prime Minister, Government ministers and other visitors to BAOR culminating in the visit to Germany by HM The Queen.   In all he has been personally responsible for 22 operations.
     He has impressed all by the magnificent way he has carried out these tasks.   The operations have involved long painstaking hours spent in reconnaissance and preparation.   He has carried  them out with exceptional thoroughness.   The strain of such armed duties and the responsibility for the safety of the principal were immense.   Major Townsend met each task with a renewed vigour, complete dedication and devotion to duty which brought each operation to a successful conclusion in a most highly professional manner.
     In addition to the planning of the operations Major Townsend participated fully in each one, putting himself in potentially the most vulnerable and dangerous position in the immediate vicinity of the principal.   He has fearlessly led from the front on all operations and the example he has set to his subordinates has been in the highest leadership tradition of the Service.
     He is most deserving of recognition for his outstanding, unflinching performance of particularly hazardous operations as BAOR Close Protection Officer for the period August 1982 to may 1984, these duties have been carried out in addition to his primary employment as Officer Commanding 113 Provost Company in support of an Armoured Division in BAOR.

PRIOR TO CAPTURE.  on the 11 June ""A"" Coy, 5/Gordons was in position outside ABBEVILLE and was under very heavy fire but remained in this position for the night.
CAPTURE. On the following morning, 18th June, at 10a.m. P.S.M (Platoon Sergeant Major) Clubbs' C.O. Capt. Keith, came to him, as Platoon Commander, and told him that it was no use going on fighting individually, to cease fire and rendesvous about 500 yards behind his position.   P.S.M Clubbs immediately formed up with men in a small wood and told them to break up their rifles, bury their ammunition and destroy all pay books and papers.   He then marched them down to the field where the remainder of the Battalion had formed up.   They were surrounded by German tanks which were armed with machine guns.   Before marching away Clubbs told his men, that, although they had surrendered, they were not to be downhearted and should if possible escape.
At about 11.30 a.m. all started to march east towards Germany.   For the first 2 days they received no food because the Germans had not any to give P/W.   P.S.M. Clubbs was told by one of the Germans that they had not expected to make so may P/W and therefore had not provided for them.   On the third day they received some brown beans, which was their diet for the next 6 days.   On the tenth day they received some white bread which the Germans had commandeered;  by then they had reached the village of FLEXICOURT.   P.S.M. Clubbs had made up his mind to escape long before this and was awaiting a suitable opportunity.
ESCAPE.  Clubbs noticed that when the Germans came to a German grave by the roadside, all the guards turned their eyes towards the grave to see whose name was on it and when they reached FLEXICOURT, they passed about 20 graves on the left hand side of the road.   When all eyes were turned to the left, he dived into the hedge on the right and lay there till the column  had passed.
That night he spent in a wood nearby and begged some food at an old farmhouse (21st June);  he obtained some civilian clothes here, but kept his boots.   On the morning of the 22nd June, he set off to march towards the coast.   He had noticed about 10kms. back that there was a lot of British ammunition lying on the roadside.   He visited this place to see if he could do anything about blowing it up, but as it was nearly all aerial bombs, there was nothing he could do about it.
About 6 days later he arrived at the village of MARIEL about 3 kms. east of ABBEVILLE.   Here he met an Englishman who had lived in France for a number o years and passed as a Frenchman.   He remained with him for 2 days.   As this man's house was on the main road (AMIENS to ABBEVILLE), Clubbs saw German transport moving backwards and forwards.   Here he got as much information as possible as to his position and realised that he could not make his escape from the coast, so decided to go south to SPAIN. 
He walked from ABBEVILLE to OISMEONT, through AUMALE, GRANDVILLIERS, MAREILLE to BEVAUVAIS.    In BEAUVAIS he saw a lot of troop movement towards MEULAN.   On his way he passed through the village of SELLES ST DENIS, where he met the local Major who gave him food and lodging and sent him on his way.   This man had previously been a school teacher in Margate.   he recommended Clubbs, in a letter, which he gave him, to the Major of SEILLY, about 40 kms. away.
He made his way to SEILLY where he met the Major, who lodged him for 3 days and was very kind to him.   The Major also gave him information about the crossing of the SEINE.   When he left SEILLY, he made for MEULAN but was unable to cross here and went along the river west to LIMAY and down to NANTES, where he crossed by night by swimming,   The following information was given to him by the Major before leaving SEILLY:-  Headquarters of the German Police was at VERSAILLES.   There were two Kommandaturs and the military area started south of the SEINE.
Immediately on crossing the SEINE, Clubbs came into contact with large bodies of German troops and found this state of affairs the same as far as the line of demarcation.   He then moved south towards CHARTRES but as this town was full of Germans, he avoided it and moved to CHATEAUDUN.   Here he remained for 2 days;   the town was full of Germans and guards were walking the streets.
On leaving CHATEAUDUN, moving south towards the LOIRE, about 2 miles from this town, he passed a large German flying field.   He was told by a farmer that this aerodrome had been bombed by the R.A.F.   on the previous Sunday and it could be seen that three hangars had received a lot of attention and that the Germans were filling in holes and changing the pisitions of their Flak.   Coming south through towards CHATEAUDUN and BEAUGENCY, he passed the village of VOVES, where there was a large concentration camp for the Frnehc P/W.   Before crossing the Loire at BEAUGENCY, he stopped a French evacuee who was going north and asked him if the Germans were stopping everyone and asking for ""Laissez pusser"".   He said they were not, so he walked across.
Clubbs then made his way towards RORMORANTAN but before reaching this place, he stopped at the village of VERNOU, where he met a Frenchman who put him up for 3 days, and gave him some information about crossing the line of demarcation.   He then introduce himn to the Baron at the chateau at VERNOU, who gave him a letter to the cure of MENNETON.   He went and saw the cure, who showed him a good place to pass over.   That night, the cure arranged with a boy to throw stones into the river CHER at one spot to attract the German sentry's attention while clubbs crossed at another.   Here he swam across.
After crossing the LOIRE, he made his way to CHATEAROUX, which was the H.Q. of the German Army in the northern unoccupied area.   From CHATEAUROUX he continued to LIMOGES,where he saw a number of German staff officers in cars.   From LIMOGES, he went to NIXON, where he was given help at the chateau.   From here he proceeded to BRIVE and on to CAHORS and so to TOULOUSE.   Just before reaching TOLOUSE, he saw an aerodrome which had been recently constructed, but not yet in use;  it was well camouflaged with nets.
From TOLOUSE he went to PERPIGNAN, where he got in touch with the American Vice-Consul, who gave him information about the crossing the Spanish frontier, bu as he could not give him any money, Clubbs decided to go to MARSEILLES.   He got as far as NARBONNE, where he was arrested by the French, and sent to the internment camp at St. CYPRIEN.   He he met Capts. Johnson and Trythall and they made plans to escape across the frontier, which the did about a month later.
They learnt from a French Lieutenant that they were to be moved to AGDE and so decided to get away before this happened.   They set off walking towards the frontier in the morning and arrived at the top of the PYRENNEES that night slightly east of COL De BANOLLES.   They crossed the frontier the next morinng and made their way towards ESPOLLA.  Before reaching this town, they were sopped by CARABINEROS, arrested and taken to ESPOLLA.   From this point onwards, Clubbs' story is the same as that of Capt. Johnson with whom he went eventually to GIBRALTAR.

Citation:  WOI BISHOP is Regimental Sergeant Major of the Military Prison and Detention Barracks at Shepton Mallet.
     At about 1220 hours on 10th March 59 he was with the Commandant in the Specials Block of the MP & D B when shouting and banging was heard coming from the direction of the Imprisonment Wing.
     He at once went to the Imprisonment Wing, taking two members of the Staff with him.   Upon his arrival there he found a mutiny with violence in progress with which the small number of Staff present were unable to contend, items of kit were being thrown at the staff he immediately set about restoring order.
     Almost twenty of the prisoners were collected at the top of the narrow staircase armed with various makeshift weapons threatening anyone who approached.   Undeterred by either verbal or physical threats to his person, he forced his way up the stairs and attempted to reason with the mutineers.
     These mutineers would not listen to reason and eventually barricaded themselves into two cells.   Later in the evening it became necessary to remove by force four prisoners who had barricaded themselves in a cell and reused to come out.   Bishop led the party of his Staff ordered to accomplish this task and showed great personal courage in so doing.   His calmness and leadership during this exacting time is evidence by the fact that although there was a violent struggle none of the prisoners was injured.
     Throughout the whole incident which lasted about seven hours, RSM Bishop showed outstanding courage, his calm and efficient leadership was largely instrumental in quelling the mutiny in so short a time.

     There were two other members of the Staff on duty at the time.   The senior Staff Sergeant ? became ineffective and the RAF Flight Sergeant was put out of action through injuries.
    This left Staff Sergeant Marsh entirely on his own for some minutes.   He reused to submit to the mutineers and although violently attacked by the resisters with great courage he tried hard to fight his way to the alarm bell.
     By his action he gained valuable time and this enabled others to reach the scene with reinforcements before the mutineers had gained complete control of the situation.
     Had he not continued to resist with great physical and moral courage the mutineers would undoubtedly have held the Staff as hostages and made the quelling of this disorder infinitely more difficult.

Citation:   Over the past three years 52 MCTC has been called upon to perform tasks extraordinary to MPSC duties.   Filling of thousands of water cans for transport to troops in operations in desert countries, providing security patrols during the emergency, erection of tented camps for the reception of troops from UK by air, the safe custody of some 90 Turkish detainees, gravedigging during the strike and curfew periods.   All of which have been notified as most urgent and at very short notice.   WOII MCKENZIE, in addition to his normal duties has worked long hours, and only his devotion to duty (often a 20 hour day) and his untiring determination to complete the task in hand has enabled the tasks to be completed with military precision.
     At the period when only one officer was available to 52 MCTC WOII MCKENZIE most proficiently assumed the duties of administration officer, arranging reception, stores, checking property, medical cover, secure accommodation, and rations and cooking facilities for the detainees.   The difficulties of religious prejudices even in things like toilet facilities will be appreciated.   The fact that not one complaint was raised against HM Government denotes how well these tasks were completed, and the commanding Officer was able to devote whole time to executive duties solely as a result of WOII MCKENZIE's efforts.   These duties he performed in addition to normal discipline duties with soldiers under sentence, unit chief clerk, movements clerk, pay clerk, SUS documentation clerk and confidential clerk, any on of which can be considered a full time employment for one man.
     These extra duties have naturally entailed long and arduous hours and from May 1957 until May 1960 WOII MCKENZIE did not have one day leave of absence from duty.   In fact I have only known his to request time off duty and the for the purpose of attending BMH as a blood donor.
     WOII MCKENZIE has carried out duties far beyond that expected from a Warrant Officer, with zeal and proficiency and without and consideration for personal comfort or reward.
     It is strongly recommended that these service, rendered under the most difficult circumstances, be rewarded by official recognition.

Citation: RSM HITCHCOCK enlisted as a Boy Apprentice in the Royal Engineers on 19 Jan 1939.   He completed his apprentice training on 25 November 1941 and served with various RE units in UK.   He took part in fighting in North West Europe from 6 June 1944 until May 1945 when he transferred to MPSC.
   His service in MPSC has taken him to BAOR, JAPAN, HONG KONG, and since 1959 to the MCTC, COLCHESTER.   He was promoted Sergeant in 1945, WOII in 1953 and WOI in March, 1959, and was awarded the Long Service & Good Conduct Medal in October 1956.
     He has now been RSM of the Military Corrective Training Centre, COLCHESTER the most senior appointment in the Military Provost Staff Corps since February 1961.
     This involves not only the day to day running of the Military Corrective Training Centre, but the handling of approximately one hundred WOs and senior NCOs.
     Since his appointment he has worked untiringly, both during official hours and in his own time to improve the efficiency of the Centre.   The high standards of turnout, just discipline and man management attained by the NCOs and WOs of this Centre is in no small measure due to the example, work and guidance of RSM HITCHCOCK.
     His own conduct, both in his official and private life is exemplary and sets the standard for all.   In him are personified the best qualities of a good regular Warrant Officer;  devotion to duty, loyalty to his superiors, scrupulous fairness in dealings with those under him, and the ability willingly to carry out his orders to the letter even though he may not be in agreement with them.
     Throughout the time he has held his present appointment RSM HITCHCOCK has demonstrated how fully he has the interests of the Army, his Corps and this Centre at the art, and he has been unswerving in his loyalty and unfailing in his efficiency.
     It is considered that this Warrant Officer fully deserves the award of the MBE in recognition of both his long and outstanding service to the MPSC as a whole and the MCTC COLCHESTER in particular.

Citation:   Staff Sergeant MATTHEWs enlisted in the East Surrey Regiment on 15 April 1945, and transferred to MPSC in March, 1953.   He has served with his original regiment and the MPSC at various times in INDIA, AUSTRIA, HONG KONG, LIBYA and MALTA.
     He was specially selected in January 1962, to be the NCO in charge of the punishment block at the Military Corrective Training Centre, COLCHESTER.   This important appointment is one of the most difficult in the MPOSC for it involves dealing, all the time, with the most awkward and obstinate as well as some of the lowest principled soldiers and airmen under sentence.
     Staff Sergeant MATTHEWS has at all times maintained a scrupulously correct manner and exactly the right balance between severity and understanding in his handling of soldiers under sentence.   He has set a very high example to the NCOs under his command and it it largely due to his efforts that the reputation of the punishment block is as high as it is..
     In addition to carrying out his normal duties in a superlative manner, he has achieved outstandingly good results in his handling of a number of recalcitrant but misguided soldiers under sentence.   It is in this particular sphere, that he has rendered above average service to the army as a whole and this Corps in particular.   As a result of his tact, patience, understanding and excellent man management, a number of soldiers are now completing their engagements in the normal way, who before being placed in his charge might well have been discharged for misconduct.

Citation:   Staff Sergeant Murray first enlisted into the Durham Light Infantry n 1951 and served for four years, which included a tour in Korea where he was mentioned in dispatches.   He then served as an Inspector in the Kenya Police until the end of the Mau Mau emergency when he rejoined the Durham Light Infantry before transferring to the Military Provost Staff Corps in 19?
     For the past eight years he has been in charge of the Military Corrective Training Centre Farm which comprises gardens and a piggery of 300 pigs.   The purpose of this farm is to provide constructive and useful rehabilitation training for servicemen under sentence prior to their discharge into civilian life.   Throughout his period in charge of the farm he has devoted all his working time and many of his own leisure hours to completely modernising every aspect of the farm and redesigning the pig breeding and rearing facilities.   He has so enthused the imagination of the servicemen committed to his charge that they  have volunteered their efforts for the construction work and the day to day labour required.   By involving these servicemen in the management aspects and in planning, he has given them a new sense of purpose and equipped them with a skill and with a fresh outlook on life which was lacking before.   He has taken a deep personal interest in the servicemen under his care, sparing no efforts to ensure that he has imparted to each and every one his own considerable experience and knowledge, so that they are fully equipped to earn a useful living on discharge.   he has even sought to resettle several with prospective employers and sometimes with success.
     Staff Sergeant Murray's efforts have been well beyond the call of duty.   He has by his own example, skill and devotion set an example to everyone in his Corps and by his unremitting dedication he has been personally responsible for the successful rehabilitation of many servicemen at the end of their sentence.   It is strongly recommended that his exceptional efforts and devotion should be recognised by an award.

Citation:  Sgt Cavan joined the Military Provost Staff Corps in 1976 after service in the Royal Corps of Transport in many parts of the world including Aden and the Radfan.
For the past four years he has been in charge of the Military Corrective Training Centre farm which comprises extensive gardens and a piggery of 200 pigs.   The purpose of this farm is to provide constructive and useful rehabilitation training for Servicemen under Sentence before their discharge to civilian life.   Throughout his time in charge of the farm Sgt Cavan has devoted all his working time and many of his own leisure hours in re building the whole structure on a new site.   The original design was his, and he has been so enthusiastic about it and has so fired the imagination of the Servicemen committed to his charge, that in addition to their normal duty they have volunteered their efforts for the construction work, and the every day labour required for completion within a year.   By involving these  Servicemen in management aspects and in planning, he has given them a new sense of purpose and equipped them with a skill and a fresh outlook on life which was lacking before,   he has taken a very deep personal interest in every Serviceman in his care, sparing no efforts to ensure that he has imparted each and every one his own considerable experience and knowledge so that they are fully equipped to earn a useful living on discharge.
In summary, Sgt Cavan is an exceptional, loyal and energetic NCO for whom nothing is too much trouble.   He is a born leader who gives up almost all his spare time for the benefit of others.   In view of his outstanding quality he is strongly recommended for an appropriate award.

Citation:   In October 1980, as a result of industrial action by Prison Warders, the Home office requested military assistance for the Prison Authorities.   At only 4 hours notice Major Andrews was despatched to the recently built Frankland Prison, Co Durham, to advise the newly appointed civilian Governor, and the Commanding Officer of the administering Regiment on the employment of servicemen in the prison.   With outstanding tact, initiative and skill Major Andrews established himself as the catalyst between the various civilian and service elements involved.   His sound advice, ensure that the prison got off to an exemplary start.   Prisoners were received without incident at many times the rate of a normal civilian prison and the establishment attained its maximum operating level in t remarkably short time, continuing to function smoothly without incident during the period of military involvement.
When it was decided to open Rollestone Prison on Salisbury Plain, Major Andrews was again despatched at very short notice to advise the Governor and the Commanding Officer.    With the same cheerful dedication and determination he melded the civilian and service effort to the same brilliant effect as at Frankland, despite the very different nature of Rollestone Camp.     At all hours of the day and night, from the time that the first prisoner was committed at Frankland to the moment that Rollestone closed, his presence and example were an inspiration to all, including the prisoners.   Without a doubt, Major Andrews was key factor in the success of operations, both at Frankland and Rollestone Prisons.   His outstanding and dedicated contribution throughout the entire operation earned the unstinted admiration and thanks of the Home Secretary.   Recognition of this quite exceptional service would prover very popular in both military and gubernatorial prison service circles.

Citation.   The overcrowding and industrial unrest in the civil prison caused the Home Officer to set up two temporary prisons in Army Camps in April 1988.   These prisons were run by servicemen under the supervision of Prison Service Governors in a Military Aid to the Civilian Community operation known as ' Operation Cutter'.   As Adjutant of the MCTC, Lieutenant Colonel Andrews was responsible for updating the contingency plans for manning temporary prisons.   his experience, energy and meticulous staff work enabled the Army Camps to be quickly converted, staff assembled and trained to become operational in less than three weeks.
Without any thought for his personal convenience he volunteered to be the military commander of HMP Rollestone and applied himself to rapidly weld his mixed military command into an efficient warder team.
He sought to inculcate firm, disciplined relationships with the inmates, despite the lax regimes preferred  by the junior governors, the majority of whom were rotated weekly from a variety of prisons.   He gave  close support and guidance to the many young NCOs who found their duties unfamiliar, arduous, stressful and sometime threatening as they dealt with violent offenders and social misfits serving long sentences.   meeting these challenges called for high standards of leadership and moral courage.   Lieutenant Colonel Andrews set a tireless example of fortitude and good humor which was much respected and admired buy the military staff, governors and inmates.
'Operation Cutter' attracted a large number of important military and civilian visitors who never failed to be impressed by his competence, tact and devotion to duty.   he has been an outstanding ambassador for the Army who has brought this difficult and demanding operation to a successful conclusion fully deserving public recognition.

Citation: Major MORGAN-OWEN has been DAA & QMG of this Bde since July 44.   throughout the whole of this time he has never missed a single action in which the Bde has fought, in France, Belgium and Holland.
     It is entirely due to his zeal and ability and despite many problems and difficulties that the administration of the Bde has constantly been maintained at the highest level.   This has only been achieved by his personal efforts which have involved long hours of work under difficult circumstances particularly during the severe winter months, when the problems of supply were many times increased.   Major Morgan-OWEN'S successful administration has been largely due to his excellent powers of organisation and his ability always to find time to make personal contact with
     Throughout the whole campaign he has not spared himself in his efforts to do all that was possible for the  general well-being of the units for which he was responsible and there is not doubt that his efforts have been highly successful.

This officer having no previous infantry experience joined ARTFORCE on 10 Dec 1943.   He took over a troop which rapidly became the most efficient in the force.   This was entirely due to his spirited determination and personal hard work.   For a month before the final withdrawal from the TIDDIM area, his troop had been right forward at MONGLANG deep in enemy country in constant touch with the JAPS.   His was the last sub-unit in the whole Division to receive orders to withdraw.   By skillful planning and leadership, in spite of being surrounded by superior enemy forces who held the initiative, he successfully extricated his troop (with only four casualties).   At the same time unknown, but certainly more, casuaties were inflicted on the enemy.    During the withdraw his party contacted another superior force of JAPS, many of who were sleeping, without hesitation he engaged them with grenades, achieving great surprise and creating such confusion that his party was able to fade out and reform having again caused material damage to the enemy without loss to themselves.   He finally led his part back in a 60 mile march to rejoin the regiment as M.S. 126.   Cheerful, and confident through, his leadership was a grand example to the troop.

Many snipers still existed in bunkers and the monsoon drains, and sniping was going on.   On arrival at a causeway which was the only existing route to the area in which the div was to be situated, Capt BONNY noticed that the road had been mined and booby trapped.   As the time factor was most important and sending back for organised sapper party would only have delayed the movement, he without any hesitation started clearing the mines and disconnecting the booby traps.   Having done this, the recce elements advanced until they reached a bridge which had to be crossed.   Here again it was discovered that aerial bombs had been placed under the bridge.   Once again without any regard for his personal safety, Capt BONNY helped to remove the fuses from these bombs thus allowing the move of the remainder of the div to continue with the least possible delay.   The immediate action taken by this officer, who has no technical knowledge of dealing with mines, and booby traps, set an high example to the men under his command and ensured the free movement of the div forward without any further delay and possible loss of life.   this officer has commanded the Div Pro Unit since Sept, 42; throughout the operations in TIDDIM, IMPHAL and Central BURMA he has consistently proved himself to be a courageous leader of his unit and has always been most evident organising and encouraging his extended CMP posts.

9425,22500,,3, WO 373/61,677 -678,,"Citation: On surrendering, 22/23/6/42 at TOBRUCH, the Battalion was given three hours grace, so as many officers as could walked away.
Lt. NICOL walked due south from 3 am till 6 am with his corporal, batman and runner, arriving just below the EL ADEM escarpment, where they hid all day.   He had only a map, compass and a few provisions when he set out.   They lost the corporal during the day, who probably joined another party from the Battalion.
On 26/6/42 Lt. NICOL plotted his route to south of BUQBUQ - the limit of his map - as follows:  NEIMUM, B.512, B.463, Bir HAGFET EL HAREIRA, Bir ED DLEUA, Bir EL HAMERIN, crossed wire at Point 46, Trig 205, SIDI SULIMAN, SAWANI OGIRIN, Bir SUF.   They took ten days, covering about 120 miles in the most trying conditions as they did not always find water at the Birs, and were naturally very weak.   On 1/7/42 they had to leave the runner as he had been wounded.   Lt. NICOL continued alone with his batman.
They nearly gave themselves up on 4/7/42 at Bir SUF as they had been three days without food or water.   But on their way to the road to find a German convoy they discovered an old encampment with much food and water.   They rested here till 10/7/42.
They then walked S.E, helped by Arabs now and again.   Dvr HOSSACK (who has also been recommended for an award) joined them, but soon after, on 23/7/42, they lost the batman, so Lt. NICOL continued alone with Dvr. HOSSACK
The same day a German truck appeared, salvaging,   Lt NICOL and Dvr. HOSSACK hid under an abandoned Indian vehicle.   When the Germans approached they seized them, too them two miles into the desert and left them.   They drove about in the German vehicle looking for the batman, but as there were several German salvage parties near, finally moved off.
On 27/4/42 they reached the Italians at 18.30 hours, but having removed  cap and badges of rank, drove fearlessly past sentries and staff cars till they reached the centre of the box.   Here they could not escape as there were sentries all round, so they abandoned the lorry and slept in a slit trench.
At 06.00 hours they slipped from the box and hid in a wide trench.   Three Italians looked at them, but thought they were German as they continued taking nonchalantly.   In the evening, though there were groups of Italians moving about, Lt. NICOL and Dvr. HOSSAK worked their way to the wire.   A sentry shouted ""Arresta"" and rushed forward, but they walked away from him without increasing their pace.   Just as they thought he would shoot, or they forced to give themselves up, he turned his attention to a working party and they escaped through a hole in the wire.   The contacted our lines next morning 25/7/42.
Lt. NICOL covered over 200 miles on foot and 130 in the truck, and was at large in most gruelling conditions for 33 days.   A very fine feat of courage and endurance.

At NE of Birghte (MR 9406 sheet No ), on April 1st 1945, ""A"" Company was ordered to clear the position known to be held by enemy from the heavily wooded west flank.   The Company got about 400 x into the woods when quite suddenly heavy fire was opened on it on three sides pinning down any attempt at movement.   major tapper attempted to move round to a flank with his reserve platoon, but again found himself outflanked by enemy fire.   With the whole unit pinned, the enemy commenced counter-attacking.   During the three hours between 17.00 hrs and 20.00 hrs five counter attacks were put in.   These attacks were in superior numbers to our own force, and each time, ""A"" Coy suffered casualties.   All Leaders including two officers, the CSM, two Sgts and 6 Corpls were killed or wounded, and also 50% of the Company.   By superb coolness and personal bravery, Major Tapper rallied his men after each counter-attack.   With no leaders to rely upon he went to each of his sub-units encouraging them and coordinated their positions  Ammunition ran short, and Major Tapper organised the collection from casualties and redistribution.   During the whole time the Company was under constant rifle and MG fire from a very mobile enemy, who turned out to be considerably superior in numbers.   But for  Major Tapper's example and complete control of the situation was an inspiration to all who saw him.

He personally supplied his Bren guns with ammunition, organised relief's on the guns and exchanges of guns when those in action became jammed or otherwise un-serviceable.
     Throughout the day his behaviour was as cool as if he had been on the barrack square.   There is no doubt that he played a large part in delaying for so long the enemy's advance.

One of his accomplices was found in a bedroom dressed in military uniform and another, dressed in civilian clothes hiding in a sack.   Further enquiries led to the arrest of two more deserters, one of whom was an American, in the possession of a stolen Jeep, but only after a struggle in the course of which, the latter was disarmed of a Browning Automatic pistol.   In their possession was a considerable sum of money and quantities of jewellery were found in the houses of civilians who had been harbouring all five men.   These civilians have since been arrested.   From evidence to hand it became evident that these men were responsible for several armed robberies in the environs of AVELLINO, which had begun some ten months previously.   Many of the victims of these robberies have now been traced by CSM PROCTER and their property identified.   Once these men had effected a hold-up on one road they would immediately switch to another part of the country.   On occasion they would represent themselves as Military Police.   Operating in the dark, identification by their victims was made extremely difficult.

All the racketeers were armed and vigorously resisted arrest.   He set an excellent example to other members of the section throughout the case, always choosing the most dangerous tasks himself.   The successful completion of this investigation, for which he was so largely responsible, resulted in the breaking up of the largest Black Market racket, in the British Area in FRANCE.  W.D. Property to the value of 11,000 was recovered and the total preventative value was may times that amount.   CAEN January 1945.

During the period November 1944 to May 1945, Capt F W Johnson was detached from his normal staff duties as DAPM (SIB) Provost Branch, at HQ No 2 District to investigate pilferages of WD stores in transit on the railways in southern Italy.   These investigations were carried out single handed by Capt Johnson in Naples, Salerno, Rome areas, and forwarded to the then Army Railhead at Arezzo, and required great tact, patience and perseverance on the part of Capt Johnson under arduous conditions of weather during the winter, coupled with extreme discomfort in travelling the railways in supply trains to produce the constructive results he achieved.   His investigations have resulted in a considerable tightening up of the security procedure for WD stores in transit, breaking up and arrest of a number of train thieves in organized gangs, and the formation of a special railway police investigation section.

Despatch of Lt Gen G F Milne CB, DSO, Commanding British Salonika Army:  I take this opportunity to bring to notice the excellent work performed by the Military Police.   In an unaccustomed situation with troops of five allied nations, in addition to a mixed population their work has been very heavy and varied in character.   At all times this has been performed with cheerfulness, zeal, and discretion and the method employed in the control of traffic and the movements of inhabitants had invariably proved effective.

     Major D W L MELVILLE has served as APM of this Corps since February 1943.
     During this period he has been responsible for solving the many complicated problems of traffic control and direction firstly in the advance from TRIPOLI to SFAX and recently in the SICILIAN campaign.
     The latter period; with winding and narrow roads, blown in many places has been particularly difficult.
     Major MELVILLE, by personal visits, often up to the most forward troops, has not only ensured the access of road traffic and control but has set a magnificent example to all ranks of the Provost Service in the Corps and its satellite formations.

From the time that this Headquarters arrived in the B.L.A. in Aug 1944 he has been confronted with problems of considerable complexity and magnitude and he has surmounted these with remarkable ability in every case.   Throughout the period his task has been to supervise all Provost activities in the Area (comprising several Sub Areas) whilst the means at his disposal, both in Staff and in Provost units, have been of necessity just adequate for the purpose.   By his energy, personal example, sound good sense and knowledge of Provost duties he has fulfilled his manifold responsibilities with marked success.
In addition to normal Provost duties he has displayed untiring zeal in the elimination of the widespread 'black market' activities affecting the troops, and his efforts in this direction have been the means of recovery of considerable sums of public money.   He has furthermore by his forceful personality, ensured the willing cooperation of the French police services.

Citation:  6025836 Pte. Calvert, Marmaduke Henry. This signaller was attached to ""B"" Coy.   On 29 Nov when the enemy attacked with tanks and infantry & at 1700hrs over ran the left forward platoon of ""B"" Coy, the line to Bn HQ was cut for the 2nd time by shell fire.   At this time it was of the utmost importance to maintain communications between Coy HQ and Bn HQ.   Pte Calvert immediately went out and repaired the break.   During the time the break was being repaired he was under continuous and heavy fire from Arty and from tanks at a range of 400 yds and bullets and splinters striking the ground all round him.  Owing to this courageous act, communications were maintained, thereby enabling the defence to be successfully conducted and the Coy positions eventually to be completely re occupied.

As A.P.M. on entry into TRIPOLI town on 23 Jan 43 up to the time of his relief on 10 Mar 43 he particularly distinguished himself in his administration as head police executive in this captured town, taking charge of police matters civil and military in such a manner that law and order was established from the first day of occupation.   A visit of the Prime Minister and many ceremonial parades too place during this period.   The police arrangements were in the charge of Major MANDY and on all occasions went without hitch and without at any time interfering with Dock traffic or other movements of military importance.

Citation:  This Officer has commanded his unit since landing in Normandy and was responsible for Traffic Control and signposting of the Army Road-head from the first break-out.   During the advance he was severely tested because of the rapidity of the move and the number of Army Road-heads or Cushions for which arrangements had to be made.   The work of his unit was of a very high order and this officer, by his drive and determination, largely contributed to the speed at which new Road-heads were established.
He has commanded his unit with outstanding success in all departments, and by his personal example of devotion to duty has inspired all ranks under his command.

On the 27th July 1952, whilst on leave and on his way home, L.Col R Staton  was informed by two children that an elderly widow was asleep in an upstairs room in their house which was on fire.   L/Cpl Staton immediately ran to the house, forced his way through a downstairs window and went upstairs to the bedroom.   The woman was found in a dazed condition in a corner of the bedroom which was full of smoke.   A couch inside the room was ablaze and flames were preventing the woman fro leaving the room.   As L/cpl Staton approached, the woman collapsed.   he picked her up and carried her safely to the care of her neighbours.   Returning to the house L/Cpl Staton again went through the smoke an managed to put out the fire with buckets of water.   Through his prompt action L/Cpl Staton undoubtedly saved the life of the widow.   The Army Commander directs that an entry to the above effect shall be made in this NCO's documents.   L/Cpl Staton has been awarded the certificate of the Society for Protection of Life from Fire.",,826,

Citation:  RQMS SELMES first joined the Territorial Army in the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment on 16 Sept. 1937.   He was embodied on 3 Sept 1939 but on 2 Jan 1940 he was transferred to the Reserve being under age for active service.   He re-enlisted again the the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment on 15 Dec 41 and served with them in the United Kingdom, the Middle East and North West Europe until May, 48.   During this period he reached the tank of WS/WOII in which rank he was very well reported on for his high sense of duty and general ability.
     From 11 May 48 to 11 Dec 52 he served at the Home Counties Training Brigade Centre, The School of Infantry and at the Depot of the Buffs.   In all of these appointments, as a WOII he was reported on as outstanding in every way and was recommended for accelerated promotion.
     He eventually transferred to the Military Provost Staff Corps on 3 Dec 53.   In this Corps he has once again shown himself to be outstanding both as a training instructor and on 'Q' duties.   He is a good disciplinarian, entirely loyal and very hardworking having no regard for the hours that he works except to finish the task in hand.
     Whilst employed in the Quartermaster Stores as a Sergeant he quickly mastered the problem and in a very short time was able to instruct two senior NCOs in their duties of RQMS.   Since then he himself has been promoted to RQMS in which post he has shown himself to be exceptionally capable.
    There is not doubt that he is an outstanding personality who carries out his duties with great efficiency, and has the confidence of respect of all those both above and below him.   His industry and devotion to duty have again earned him a further recommendation for accelerated promotion.

Citation: WOII WRIGHT was taken on strength 52 MCTC during a period when the locking up numbers were at maximum and when there was an acute staff shortage.   WRIGHT who was then a S/Sgt assumed the duties of i/c discipline side in the MCTC and quickly introduced maximum unit security.   A short while later the unit was called upon to become self accounting in all respects and S/Sgt WRIGHT without any previous experience voluntarily attended another unit to learn 'Q' a/c during his off duty hours and set about organising a 'Q' stores within the unit.
     The unit was then requested to administer the Dhekelia Area 'bunting pool' and still further the defence stores for 3 Inf Bde Gp.   These extra tacks devolved on S/Sgt WRIGHT and such was the responsibility accepted by WRIGHT that a request was submitted for the grant of local WW II to maintain prestige and this was approved by the Brigade Commander.   The success achieved by WO II WRIGHT has been clearly confirmed by the last two inspections by the Command Secretariat when there were no observations.
     The above tasks have been carried out in addition to the normal routine duties required to be performed by WRIGHT and the high standard has been achieved solely as a result of the unselfish disregard that WO II WRIGHT has shown for his own personal comfort by working long arduous hours to perform tasks above that normally performed by a person of his rank, and at the same time maintain the highest standard of efficiency in his Regt duties.   That WRIGHT should voluntarily attend another unit during his off duty period to gain experience discloses high soldierly qualities and that he undertakes to perform extra duties normally reserved for a higher rank without any reward is most commendable.
     All these extra duties have been performed at a time when only one officer is available to the unit and fully committed with executive, administrative and Regt duties, including the maintenance of six separate accounts.   Only the zeal and devotion to duty has permitted the unit to maintain a high standard of efficiency without an increase in establishment.
     It is considered that the loyalty to the service shown by WO II WRIGHT in the continued working of long hours 0630 -1830 most days and often till 21.30 when required, without a break for leave of absence is most deserving and strongly recommend consideration be given to his recognition.

On the 20th May 1941 the Sqn was in its leaguer area approx four miles west of CANEA, CRETE.   At 08.30 hrs the German parachutists arrived.   At approx 10.30 hrs Captain Crewdson went off with one other tank and knocked out an anti-tank rifle which had been causing a certain amount of damage.   On Sunday, May 25th 1941 when the Germans broke through at GALLATOS, Captain Crewdson took his own tank and one other and blocked the exit from the village.   He found three wounded men out of one of our other tanks, took them back to the aid post and then returned to the village.   On Monday 26th on receiving orders from 5th NZ Inf Bde to assist in a counter-attack, he led his three tanks in and was instrumental in holding up the Germans in spite of intense aerial activity.   On Friday 30th May 1941 just north of IMVROS on the road to SPHAKION Capt. Crewdson was with three light tanks and three Bren gun carriers.   Our orders were to hold the Germans off the main Infantry position for as long as possible.   Contact was gained at 06.45 hrs and at 07.30 hrs Capt Crewdson's tank was hit by an anti-tank rifle bullet.   The petrol tank was pierced and Capt Crewdson was wounded in the foot.   He came back in a Bren carrier and reported the situation and then returned to the other two tanks to supervise their withdrawal.   Having completed the withdrawal to the next position I ordered him into a truck as he had been bleeding a good deal and his wound was very painful.   Throughout the remainder of the day he stayed in the truck until we got him down to the beach that night.

Citation for DCM:  On 23 Jan, after the first phase of operations S.E. of ANTELOT, RSM DAVIS was ordered to tow out and attach an air line to Lieut. SLOAN'S tank which had been damaged in action.   He had connected the line and commenced to tow then the area was attacked by about 30 German tanks.   Three German tanks engaged the two tanks but Lt. SLOAN'S tank could not fire owing to the danger of breaking the air line when traversing the turret.   RSM DAVIS's gunner was temporarily knocked out, but without support he continued the tow, loaded and commanded his tank with complete calm.   He put one enemy tank out of action and damaged two others.   He brought Lt SLOAN's tank to safety N E of SAUNNU when his own tank broke down.   RSM DAVIS displayed calmness and courage of the highest degree and showed complete disregard of danger.   In the field 2/2/42.

Middle East May to Oct 1942.
This officer joined the CMP when there was no traffic organisation in the Middle East.   He at once showed marked ability in Traffic organisation in all its ramifications.   He has built up a Traffic organisation of highly skilled personnel which now numbers some 25 Officers and 700 other ranks, and 150 Greek checkers.
He has established Check Posts throughout the Middle East whereby the misuse of Government Vehicles has been greatly reduced:  Information Posts where road patrols report, and information is passed on at once to Movements as to road blocks, broken bridges, washouts.   The volume of WD traffic by the three main routes into Cairo alone is some 85,000 vehicles a month.
It is due to his organisation, and ability that this volume of traffic, and also that in the Western Desert, and other main Routes has functioned smoothly often under very adverse conditions
I cannot speak to highly of this officers's work, and untiring  devotion to duty which richly merits reward.

Citation:      During the operations on the MARETH LINE Capt. Gentles was sent forward on the night 27/28 March 43 with a Coy which had been ordered to seize part of the ""DHELI"" feature.   The night was very dark and it was known that the lower slopes were mined with A.P. mines and booby traps,   Capt. Gentles on arrival at the foot of the hill went ahead with one man and reconnoitred a way up through which his men then followed.   At day light it was found that he had passed through a mined area.   By his courageous action he undoubtedly saved casualties and enabled his men to go forward.
     During the operations in WADI AKARIT area, on 6 Apr 43, an enemy machine gun was holding up the advance from a flank.   Capt. Gentles accompanied by his batman and Lt. Tate R.A. immediately stalked the post.   Capt. Gentles and his batman killing two of the enemy with rifle fire whilst Lt. Tate engaged the post with a captured machine gun.   The post surrendered, some ten prisoners being taken.   By this prompt action the advance was able to continue.
     This officer has at all times shown a devotion to duty and leadership of the highest order.

Citation: Major Holman has commanded C Bry. 5 RHA during the period over which it has been attached to the Staffordshire Yeomanry Armoured Regimental Group from 9 Dec 42 to date.   During the whole of the operations from AGHEILA to TRIPOLI he has personally shewn outstanding powers of initiative and leadership on all occasions.
     On 15 Dec 42 when my Regt was forcing a passage over the Anti Tank ditch west of AGHEILA, Major Holman's guns were subjected to very heavy counter battery fire from numerous enemy guns.   He appreciated at once that his immediate task was to knock out the enemy heavy calibre Anti tank guns engaging my Tanks.   This object he achieved thereby saving a critical situation and many of my tanks.   His own casualties were heavy but his splendid example and utter lack of regard for his personal safety successfully turned the scale in a hard day's fighting.   This was only one of many occasions on which he shewed courage, efficiency and devotion to duty and I desire to recommend that is gallantry be rewarded.

     As DAPM 207 Sub Area during operation ""Bingham"" (involved movement of Air Forces into the Sara area of Yugoslavia between 2 - 30 April 1945 in order to provide air support to Marshall Tito's partisans).   April and May 1945, this officer's efforts and tact contributed greatly to the extremely high standard of discipline maintained by the British troops throughout, which was a very large factor in ensuring that harmonious relations with the local Jugoslavs was maintained to the very end, at a time when they had deteriorated elsewhere.   I feel it should be taken into consideration also that prior to ""Bingham"" this officer carried out similar duties with this Sub Area at PIRAEUS, GREECE, last December and January and, later, on 8th Army L of C just prior to their last offensive.   at PIRAEUS, these HQ, and localities where staff and services had to work, were frequently subjected to fire from all weapons from small arms up to 105mm guns.   Undoubtedly this officer produced an effort greater than merely his normal duties with a Sub Area.

Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and outstanding devotion to duty during the advance from BORGO SAN LORENZO towards BOLOGNA.   In the mountainous area North of MARRADI on 27 Sept. 44. the advance of the Bn. was temporarily held up by strong opposition.   It was vital to the Brigade plan to discover the exact location of certain enemy posts.   Lieut. IRELAND was ordered to take out a patrol to investigate a high feature some 1500 yards distant.   Lieut. IRELAND led his patrol over very difficult country past an enemy outpost to within 300 yards of his objective.   At this point he left the patrol and went forward himself with two O.R.'s to investigate.   On reaching the shoulder of the hill the party was fired upon by an MG. killing one, and wounding Lieut. IRELAND in the chest and arm.   Lieut. IRELAND attacked the MG post with grenades and killed the German gunner with his Tommy Gun.   Lieut. IRELAND then successfully extricated his patrol, and over the wireless personally directed arty. fire on the enemy causing them many casualties, although at this time he was in a weak state.   The information gained by the patrol was of great value to Bde. HQ.
Throughout the action Lieut. IRELAND showed great courage under fire at close quarters.   His cool daring, and utter disregard for his personal safety were an inspiration to the rest of the patrol;  while the successful conduct of the patrol was undoubtedly mainly due to his outstanding leadership.

Under his able administration these difficulties were quickly overcome.   Soon after he arrived arrangements had to be made for operation ANVIL, from that port.   The admin arrangements for and the control of the troops which were launced from TARANTO were highly satisfactory largely due to his careful planning and influence.   Since then he has been given considerable additional commitments all of which have been accepted and solved in the same cheerful and thorough manner.   Brig CALWELL (spelt CALDWELL) has been commanding an area or sub-area in this theatre of operations since early in 1943 and was instrumental in mounting operations from Sicily to the mainland.   Results he has achieved have always been of the highest order.   I recommend the award of the CBE for these services.

Whilst stationed at Hesdin, a market town, sometime in May, L/cpl Westall succeeded in stopping a runaway horse, after being dragged a considerable distance down the Rue General Tripier.

Citation:  He was in command of a platoon of D Company on the forward edge of the Heyswalt Wood on the extreme left in the battalion front.   This post was heavily shelled, both in the morning and in the evening of the 14th and each shelling was followed by an attack which was repulsed.   Owing to enemy fighting patrols it was not possible to establish communications with battalion HQ.   Accordingly PSM Fullerton set off by himself and got through to Coy. HQ and led back a fighting patrol ans stretcher bearers, thereby enabling the wounded to be evacuated.   He then led the patrol to the the Bois Cawe which was occupied by the enemy.   This he seized, capturing some 10 prisoners and leaving about 20 dead.  The following day accompanied 2/Lt Gall on his patrol and found that the forward platoon posts had been captured by the enemy.   In the evening he personally covered the withdrawal of the remainder of the Company, consisting of Capt. Lowrie and 28 men.   he displayed great efficiency and courage in the setting of booby traps and inflicted severe casualties on the enemy.    PSM Fullerton was subsequently taken prisoner as St Valery on June 11.   Some 10 days later he escaped from the Lukembony ? via Le Treport - Paris - Marseilles - Cannes - Marseilles - Barcelona and Gibraltar.

     Throughout the campaign he has Given very gallant and distinguished service in a difficult job under extremely arduous conditions.
     Major Mackie has at all times taken personal charge of the necessary reconnaissances for forward routes both for the deliberate attack and the sustained pursuit battle.   In the Normandy bridgehead particularly he personally reconnoitred under heavy fire during all battles.   By day and night he directed and supervised the marking and lighting of route effecting liaison with the forward troops and never deterred  by enemy fire.   In the assault on Le Havre and in the pursuit battle across the Seine.   He displayed determination and gallantry of the highest order.   The arduous Ardennes campaign demanded the utmost energy under the most adverse conditions and much is owed to Major Mackie's enthusiasm and drive in the month long battle in the Reichswald, and the preparation for the assault across the Rhine  and in the sustained advances which followed until the  German capitulation,  Major Mackie was constantly in the forefront of the Division ensuring that the advance of the forward troops was not impeded.
     From the beginning until the end of the campaign Major Mackie has displayed outstanding gallantry and determination.   The success of the Divisions's operations has in no small measure depended on his organisation, coolness and magnificent sense of duty and his bravery under fire on countless occasions has been admitted by all.

On 20th July 1974, during the fighting between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in Limassol following the landing of Turkish Forces in Cyprus, 3rd Troop, The Parachute Squadron, Royal Armoured Corps, led by Lieutenant Leigh were deployed on the interface between the two factions as part of the British Contingent of the United Nations Forces Cyprus.   At about 1030 hours Lieutenant Leigh led his troop along the interface in full view of both sides in order to maintain the United Nations presence, drawing small arms, machine gun and mortar fire fro both sides as he did so.   When one of his troop vehicles was damaged by mortar fire, Lieutenant Leigh engaged a dominant Greek-Cypriot machine gun position to allow the vehicle to be withdrawn under escort and as he did so he again drew heavy fire from surrounding Greek-Cypriot positions.   
     Later that morning, during attempts to negotiate a ceasefire, a British Officer, cut off by fire when he attempted to leave the Turkish Cypriot District Office, was eventually evacuated by Lieutenant Leigh who positioned his ferret scout car as near as possible to the office, and then escorted the officer on foot to the vehicle.   Throughout this short action both Leigh and the officer were frequently fired upon from several directions by Greek Cypriot National Guards.
     In order to improve the execution of the ceasefire is was necessary to arrange a further meeting between the District Officer and a United Nations Liaison Officer.   Leigh was informed that there was heavy firing in the location of the chosen rendezvous and an alternative rendezvous was to be made.   Leigh made three trips in the open, under fire, to arrange the meeting at the new rendezvous.   Throughout this action both Leigh and his Non-Commissioned Officer commander of the second ferret in the half troop.   were constantly fired upon both during the dismounted sorties and, when mounted in the scout cars.
   Throughout the day Lieutenant Leigh consistently and coolly exposed himself to fire from both sides but resolutely and courageously continued with his duties until the were thoroughly and satisfactorily completed.   His disregard for his own safety was a fine example and his perseverance did much to contribute to the eventual arrangement of peace in the area.",,,

He has supervised the growth of this establishment from an improvised tented camp to permanent hutted buildings.   During this period he has had to operate under extremely difficult and trying conditions, with lack of trained staff, inadequate accommodation, adverse climatic conditions and great shortage of water.
     As a result of his initiative and hard work he has now produced a most efficiently run unit, which has been commended on many occasions.
     Although only an acting Warrant Officer, he has often had to carry out duties normally pertaining to an officer by dealing directly with Commanding Officers and Adjutants of units and Staff Officers of the District Headquarters.   He has proved fully capable of making correct decisions and taking the full responsibility of an officer.
     The high state of efficiency of 60 Military Correction Establishment today is almost entirely due to the influence, strength of character, personal example and extreme devotion to duty of Warrant Officer Allen, under most trying conditions.

S/Sgt Ramsey, who has previously seen regular army service with the Royal Irish Fusiliers during the period 1960-1963, has served with the Territorial Army since 2965.   On the reduction of the units PSI establishment in 1974 he assumed the appointment of CQMS, duties which ha has continued to implement to date.   Due to the wide geographical spread of the unit, the inadequate establishment of PSI's and the recent receipt of the units PUE from BAOR S/Sgt Ramsey has been committed, on a regular basis, to an average of thee working days per week in order to implement his unit responsibilities.   This he has undertaken willingly and to the know detriment of his civilian occupation and domestic life.   he performs his duties in an energetic and professional manner with a high degree of dedication born out of his loyalty to the service.   His unstinting appetite and total involvement in his duties has resulted in a radical improvement in the operational readiness of the unit, and in the awareness of good administration for peace, an influence which has been brought to bear on his regular and territorial army colleagues alike.   In addition to his major responsibility he has become a well known and respected figure within Western district at functions in aid of the Army Benevolent Fund for which ha has assumed command of the special police duties.   His loyalty and devotion to his duties are legendary within the Corps setting the highest standards of service and self sacrifice to his colleagues, displaying very fully those qualities associated with voluntary service.

Citation;   By reason of the initiative, leadership and organising ability of Major Wilfred George Lloyd, Assistant Provost Marshal, provost resources with the Third Canadian Infantry Division have at all times met the exceedingly heavy demands placed upon them.   This has been most evident during the periods of active operations when traffic control on operational routes and the handling of prisoners of war have stretched provost resources to the limit.
  On every occasion involving a move of this formation, Major Lloyd has personally gone to the forward areas to ensure that traffic moved in accordance with the plan.   Many times under enemy shell fire, the presence of Major Lloyd, his coolness, fine soldierly example and ability to overcome obstacles, no matter how dangerous the situation, have been the main factor in keeping the traffic moving forward unimpeded.
     As a disciplinarian Major Lloyd has imbued all ranks with the high standard which he himself has set.   The excellent standard of discipline, deportment and esprit de corps among Provost personnel in this formation are the direct result of the insistence at all times by Maj Lloyd that all ranks not only do their job well but also under any and all conditions.
     As a soldier and leader of men Major Wilfred George Lloyd has, by his ceaseless efforts, achieved an unrivalled reputation.

Citation:   Sgt. Armstrong escaped from the P/W cage at BERLA BARRACKS near BENGASI on the 4th December at 1900 hours, with L/Cpl, CAIRD, 2/ Camerons and Dvr. MURRAY.   Escape was prepared by cutting the wire on the 3rd - all except the last two strands - making a final getaway during the changing of the guard on the 4th.
     The three had mad several individual attempts to escape previously, Sgt. ARMSTRONG getting as far as MECHILIi on one occasion.   They had also prepared an escape jointly by digging a hole through the wall.   They were betrayed though and the German military police came in, found the hole and, after a search, all their stores of food.   They has saved up 5 tins of sardines, some tongue, a small quantity of rice and macaroni, one Italian loaf, 2 tins of cheese and 5 water bottles.
     When they escaped eventually, they walked right through the barracks, waited for the moon to come up and started off S.W of BENINA, walking past REGIMA towards TECNIS.   On the 12/12/1941 they met and Arab between MARUA and SLONTA, who was a great help to them and guided them on their journey.   At this point they want South of MECHILI and were finally picked up by troops of the 7th Armd. Division south of BOMBA at 1400 hours on the 16/12/1941.
     Half-way on their journey they had a most tremendous stroke of luck in finding a miniature ration store containing bully beef and other foot stuffs, obviously left behind by us in our retirement.
     During the whole of the journey they themselves saw no signs of movement and no new tracks, but the Arabs informed them that guns and armoured cars were going westwards towards BENGHASI.
     While in BENGHASIi the men worked in food stores, docks, etc.   They were detailed every day for different jobs.   On the 27th November, Armstrong worked in the docks at unloading a sinking ship.   When they left conditions were chaotic.   They had been shut up for 5 days, no work had been done and Germans and Italians obviously did not know what do with the prisoners.
     It was cue to the great courage and unflagging determination of this NCO. was able successfully to escape with this two companions in the face of many hardships and handicaps.   They were also observant on their journey and brought back useful information.

     At all times he has shown a complete disregard for his own safety, and his cheerfulness and devotion to duty have been an inspiration to the whole regiment.
     On many occasions he has shot his guns with great effect under shell and small arms fire at almost point blank range.
     At KIME on 27 March when one of his Troop Command Tanks was hit and all the crew wounded he went forward on foot and saw to their safe removal, under small army and A/Tk. fire.   He finally drove the damaged tank back himself to a position under cover in spite of a fire in the turrett, which was causing the amm. to explode.
     He commanded the Regt. during the Irrawaddy crossings of 20 Ind. and 2 Div. in my absence as CCRA's rep.   When the position was heavily shelled on the night of 15 Feb he set a high standard under very difficult conditions showing an example to steadiness in circumstances which necessitated the greatest  care and accuracy owing to the close proximity of our own troops to DF SOS.

     WO I Burden has been RSM at the Depot and Training Establishment, Royal Military Police, since 31st August, 1955.   He is in every way the most excellent RSM and carries out his duties in the highest traditions of the British Army.
     His loyalty and devotion to the Army, the Corps and to this Depot always come before his own interests.   He is respected and held in high esteem by officers and men alike, throughout the Corps.   He is a strict disciplinarian but a very fair one.   He is particularly good in his dealings with young soldiers, many of whom have benefited from his advice and experience.   Similarly his advice has helped many warrant officers and sergeants.   His bearing, turn out, conduct and devotion to duty are an outstanding example to all ranks.
     He runs a first class Sgts' Mess in which he has made many improvements and has helped to foster and excellent spirit.   In the same way his management, as president of the Corporals' Club, had produced very fine results.   His liaison with WOs and Sgts of other units is very good and does much to foster good relations between the military police and the rest of the army.
     He is an active committee member of the Depot branch of the RMP Association and as such puts in a lot of extra work.   As a result the branch is very successful and popular and a record number of new members have joined since RSM Burden's arrival.   As a member of the RMP Association committee itself and of the RMP Central benevolent fund his advice and comments are sound and shrewd.
     His enthusiastic support for all unit sporting activities has permeated to all ranks.   His is particularly good as a MC on military boxing occasions.
     In the example he sets, in zeal, enthusiasm and devotion to duty and in the way he conducts himself, this Warrant Officer has bar exceeded the standard normally expected of a regimental sergeant major.

Citation:  During more than eight months in Northern Ireland, Regimental Sergeant-Major Poole set a splendid example to soldiers, police and civilians alike.   On 27th June 1970, he exposed himself to great danger in a clash between rival factions which resulted in the death of several persons.   Unarmed and unprotected except by a steel helmet, which was dented during the action, he made several arrests and assisted in others.
On 28th September 1970, during serious rioting, he saw a vicious crowd attacking two Royal Marines.   One Marine had been kicked and beaten unconscious; the other had his back to a wall fighting to retain his rifle.   Though he risked being shot if they obtained the rifle, RSM Poole ran alone into the mob, dragged them off the Marine with the rifle and, standing astride the unconscious man, held off the attackers with his pistol until help arrived.   There is no doubt that he saved the men from grave injury.
Throughout the period he exerted a steadying effect wherever he appeared and by his bold and courageous action averted clashes on numerous occasions.

Citation:  Captain Stock has been on active operations against the Communist Terrorist Organisation in Malay since January 1951.   During this period he has served as Intelligence Officer, Company Second-in-Command and, for the last two years, as Adjutant in the 2nd Battalion The Malay Regiment.   In all those appointments he has shown the same tireless enthusiasm and devotion to duty no matter what problems or difficulties he has had to face.   In a Battalion that is continuously deployed on operations over a wide ared, with the Command Post seldom less than one hundred miles from the main battalion base, he has had to assume responsibilities far above his rank and normal course of duty.   He has cheerfully and enthusiastically accepted those responsibilities and carried out every task in such an exemplary manner that the Battalion has received un-stinted praise from every formation, unit and individual with whom he has had to deal.
     He works tirelessly and for long hours be it for the Battalion, the Garrison, School Cadets, the Volunteer Forces or any other unit or organisation but he still makes time to visit the troops on operations and play a leading part in the operational activities of the Battalion.   His devotion to duty is quite outstanding and beyond all praise.   Due to his tireless efficiency, organisation and control of the main Base he has relieved the Command Post of a great admin load which enables the maximum concentrated effort to be made against Communist Terrorist Organisations in the field, safe in the knowledge that every demand on the main base will be promptly and efficiently at any hour of the day or night.

Lt Peter Hugh Surtees (440174), The Royal Lincolnshire Regiment.  On the 8th May, Lieutenant Surtees set out with his platoon to lay an ambush in the area to the south-west of Penang.   Early on the following morning, after a long and arduous approach march through mountainous country he located a small camp on the side of a steep hill in which he saw that there were five terrorists.   His approach to the camp  was over the mountain behind it enabled the platoon to avoid the terrorists' sentry but Lieutenant Surtees could see that the communist  terrorists were making preparations to leave.   He rapidly made his plan, placing two sections on the flank of the camp an prepared to assault with the remainder.   The re-allocation of weapons and the preliminary moves were skilfully carried out in complete silene   Although the terrorists had a dog with them, they were not alterted.
     Lieutenant Surtees led the assault on the camp with complete disregard for his own safety.   His gallantry and  determination were and inspiration to his men.   The assault was successfully pressed home with the result that one terrorist was killed and two others wounded and captured.   Thus a severe bow was dealt to the terrorist organisation in this part of Negri Sembilan.
     The complete success of this operation, skilfully out over difficult mountainous country was mainly due to the resourcefulness and inspiring leadership of Lieutenant Surtees.",,,

Citation:   Major Hyslop, a Volunteer Officer, has served as GS)"" (TAVR) Trg at HQ North East District for the past three years.
     A newly promoted Major with no previous staff experience he early on impressed with this keenness and enthusiasm for the job.   This in strict terms entailed co-ordination of, and advice on, TAVR trg with the Regular G Trg Staff and filling appointments on exercises.   With an enormous capacity for work and his great dedication he quickly assumed greater and greater responsibilities.   not content with waiting for staff tasks he has been instrumental in starting many new projects for TAVE trg.   Notably among these he personally organised and ran a comprehensive series of weekend coursed for the TAVR covering a variety of subjects not covered by Army courses for the TAVR covering a variety of subjects not covered by Army Schools and difficult to teach in units.   This entailed much forward planning and liaison with regular establishments for instructors and equipment.   In the last year these courses catered for over six hundred students.   In addition he organised and ran two highly successful helicopter training weekends each catering for over five hundred men from a variety of units.
     This successful work demanded a great deal of effort and expertise far beyond what one would normally expect from an officer of his military experience and age.   it has greatly lightened the workload on a busy G Trg staff and indeed without his endeavours and driving force much of what he has achieved might not have taken place.
     In addition to this he assists in the organisation and running of District major training events and exercises all of which demand a great deal of extra time and effort.
     This is from a Volunteer Officer, newly promoted to a responsible job with the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority, entirely in his spare time.   He has devoted upwards of one hundred training days to this service  in the past year.
     His tremendous enthusiasm, great organising ability and sheer hard work has made his name a byword and an inspiration throughout the District and his conduct and zeal are in the highest traditions of the volunteer spirit.

Citation:   Since July 1983 Staff Sergeant Dougall has been the sole representative of the Special Investigation Branch in Belize.   he has been responsible for the investigation of all crimes and serious incidents within British Forces Belize.   In carrying out his duties he has been faced with unusual difficulties.   Belize is an operational theatre in which British Forces are dispersed over wide areas of inhospitable terrain with very poor communications.   The climate is oppressive and working conditions primitive.   In particular, the overall attitudes of the native population and the sensitivities of a suspicious and autocratic Police Force are major obstacles to effective military police work.
     In the face of these problems Staff Sergeant Dougall's achievements and the long hours he has worked are remarkable.   Undeterred by the difficulties he has displayed unusual zeal and professional skill to complete a series of complex investigations.   his results, in the form of clear and accurate reports, have proved invaluable and have made a significant contribution to the effective policing of the Forces in Belize.
     In particular he has masterminded one very large and sensitive investigation for which the whole RMP Detachment had to be mobilised.   he produced a most detailed guide to assist the young RMP Corporals.   This ensured that the truth was not hidden, and that a balanced statement was produced for each interviewee.   This investigation, due to operational demands, was completed within a matter of days.   He then, single handed, processed 250 statements to produce a clear presentation of the facts.
     His calm efficiency, his dry humor and the balanced maturity that he shows in his approach to disciplinary problems are unusual in a man of his rank and experience.   That many of his investigations have been carried out amongst  an unscrupulous civil community, with the attendant physical risks and temptations is a tribute to his dedication, integrity and moral courage.   As a result the reputation of the Royal Military Police amongst both the local population and British Forces Belize has never been higher.   This outstanding performance of Staff Sergeant Dougall is worthy of formal recognition.

Citation:  For distinguished services and constant devotion to duty as Transport Major to CRASC, Eighth Army Troops during the period 1st April 1945 to 2nd May 1945.   This officer was responsible for the control and co-ordination of operating transport in the clearance of maintenance trains arriving at RIMINI, FANO, CESNA, FORLI and FAENZA as well as all that engaged in third line duties providing for the entire Army's requirements of petrol, supplies, ammunition, Ordnance and EFI Stores to different Roadheads.   The period in question was an unusually difficult one, due to the complex and ever changing nature of the Supply situation and to changes in the course of a few days, of both CRASC and second-in-command.   The operational control of task vehicles fluctuated from a minimum equivalent of 7 GT Companies to a maximum equivalent of 27 GT Companies, involving a total of more than 3,000 vehicles.   The units included British, Indian, Polish, Polish ATS, Palestinian and Italian Coys, together with a substantial addition of transport drawn from many RA and other first line sources.   The efficient and economical operation of such a heterogeneous collection of transport, the prompt clearance of Railheads, the rapid stocking of Army Depots.   This Officer has served continuously overseas for 4 1/2 years with Western Desert Force and Eighth Army and although aware that he was due to repatriation under PYTHON in early May allowed himself no relaxation whatsoever until his task was completed two days prior to his departure from the HQ.

For Gallant Leadership and Distinguished Service in the Face of the Enemy.
     During the period 1 September to 31 December 1944, WS/ Lt. R A van R Olivier has commanded the section of the 6 South African Armoured Division Provost Company attached to the 12 South African Motorised Brigade with outstanding leadership and gallantry.   From the point of view of traffic control this period was noteworthy for the fact that it produced the most difficult and complex problems any Provost officers could have been called upon to solve.   In the days preceding the battle for MONTE STANCO and during the battle itself he organised, established and maintained control so effectively over six miles of the single jeep track available that the Brigade was able to build up for and carry out the attack successfully.   This track was so narrow that except at established ""sidings"" it was ""one-way only to jeeps"";  large sections of tit were in appalling and muddy condition and under almost continuous shellfire, and, in addition to the Brigade Group, it served as the only maintenance route to three other battalions.
     Thereafter, in the battles for MONTE PEZZA, Point 806 and Point 826 which followed during the succeeding weeks he continued continued to establish and maintain control of this jeep track right forward to the leading infantry elements, thereby ensuring the smooth flow forward of ammunition and supplies and the evacuation of casualties.
     For over two months since the operations became static, he and his men have maintained traffic on similar jeep tracks, during which time track conditions have varied from deep mud and slush, to snow and slippery iced surfaces.   An outstanding feature of this period has been the maintenance of a traffic control post in GRIZZANA where he and his men have cheerfully and determinedly carried out their tasks under enemy observation and continuous shellfire, thereby ensuring the smooth flow of traffic over the section GRIZZANA - MONTE STANCO, known as the ""Mad Mile"", where traffic is subjected to direct, observed shellfire.
     The manner in which Lieutenant OLIVIER has carried out his onerous duties has been exemplary and has revealed high qualities of leadership, devotion to duty, and gallantry in the face of the enemy.

L/Cpl BURTON took over command of the section to which he belonged at WERWICQ on May 24 when all the senior NCOs had been wounded.   Though wounded himself and under heavy shelling mortar and machine gun fire he personally superintended and led all the wounded out to the position.   He then returned to find that the guns were out of action and the two remaining men had been mortared out of position.   He crawled forward, remounted the guns and kept them in action, inflicting severe losses on the enemy.   By his example, the morale of the section was completely restored and they were able to inflict further casualties to the enemy.

Brave South Shields Constable.
     Lance Corporal Whitehead, of the South Shields Police, who is serving in France with the Military Mounted Police, has earned by his bravery the warm praise of his commanding officer.   In a report the latter wrote:- His example of absolute fearlessness and calm under very trying conditions undoubtedly helped to prevent panic among a large civil population and assisted materially the work of the Army.   Lance Corporal Whitehead was proceeding down -------- road to relieve Corporal Westropp when shelling commenced.   He went to Westropps assistance and helped him in the duties he performed.   He also patrolled shops, the windows of which were broken, exposing goods, and moved soldiers standing outside the shops away from them to prevent either looting or charges of looting.   He investigated and reported to APM a case of looting involving the theft from a damaged shop of 400 francs which had been in a cash box, but the troops were not in any way involved.
     The Chief Constable of South Shields is very gratified that one of his force should have so distinguished himself, and he brought the report of Lance Corporal Whitehead's commanding officer before the Committee, which put on record their appreciation of his exemplary donduct.

     The Chief Constable of South Shields is very gratified that one of his force should have so distinguished himself, and he brought the report of Lance Corporal Whitehead's commanding officer before the Committee, which put on record their appreciation of his exemplary conduct.

     About 2 pm on the 20th December 1916, at -------, two horses attached to a GS wagon took fright and bolted down the Rue de Haillcourt. (probably Barlin)  Lance Corporal Johnson, who was on duty at the Crucifix, seeing the horses galloping up the road with no one in charge, at once ran towards them and at great personal risk, running alongside the horses, succeeded in catching hold of one of the reins and in bringing both horses to a standstill.
     ""This NCO's prompt and plucky action probably averted a serious accident, as further along the road, in which the wagon was proceeding, there was a considerable number of farmers carts.

Citation: On 28 May 1949, Sjt Clutton was ordered to take his section by a circuitous route to the edge of the jungle in SUNGEI KANTAN near KAJANG, with the object of cutting off the retreat of a gang of 20 well-armed bandits who were known to be in the this rubber in the area.   The plan was for the Police to drive the enemy into the fore of the 3 sections who were acting as stops.
     Sgt Clutton succeeded in manoeuvring his section into a concealed position in tall Lallang Grass, astride what he considered would be the bandits' line of withdrawal.   The speedy taking up of the position required a good and quick appreciation of the ground and as soon as the section were in position bursts of fire were heard, indicating that the police were already engaging the bandits.
     15 of the enemy appeared, making straight for Sjt Clutton's two Rifle Groups.   he held his fire, hoping that they would continue on until he could kill them all.   However, the bandits then saw movement from another direction of the thick rubber and at once became suspicious and ran back to cover.
Immediately Sjt. Clutton saw that the surprise was lost and that now was his only chance, he ordered his section to open fire even though the range was long.
     Four bandits were hit and fell, and under cover of automatic fire the enemy withdrew into the cover, dragging their wounded.
     Sjt. Clutton following up the blood trail for 400 yards, eventually came upon a bandit lying in a gully.   Ordering his section to cover him, Sjt Clutton then went forward himself to investigate.   As he approached the bandit exploded a grenade which seriously wounded Sjt Clutton and blew himself up.
     Regardless of his wounds Sjt Clutton continued to urge his section on to follow up the remaining bandits and would not submit to medical attention until he was satisfied his section were continuing the pursuit.
     Throughout the action Sjt Clutton set a very fine example to is men of leadership, bravery and devotion to duty and he is deserving of the highest praise.

Citation:   Over a period of many months Cpl McKENZIE has shown himself to be an NCO of outstanding courage and determination.   As section commander he has instilled offensive spirit and enthusiasm into his men, whilst as patrol leader he has invariably carried out his task coolly and intelligently.   his bravery has been demonstrated on numerous occasions.   Once he led a small raiding party behind the enemy lines to attack an isolated post suspected of being occupied.   On finding it empty he proceeded, on  his own initiative, along the communication trench, to investigate the main defences.   By approaching to within 20 yards of the enemy he was able to obtain important information which proved extremely valuable for future operations.   again, when taking part in a daylight assault on a strongly held enemy tunnel, Cpl McKENZIE displayed great audacity by exposing himself to heavy small arms fire whilst covering his patrol commander's approach to the entrance of the tunnel.  Thus protected, the patrol commander was able to silence the enemy garrison and subsequently to blow up the tunnel.   On many other less important patrols Cpl McKENZIE has always shown the same courageous spirit.   By his leadership, example to the NCO's and men of the battalion.

The OP had been moving forward with A Company under a heavy fire and by night fall the Company was pinned to the ground and isolated.
     It was essential to obtain touch with the Battalion Headquarters and Lance Bombardier McQUEEN volunteered to find his way there in the darkness and across ground covered by continuous Machine-gun fire.   This he succeeded in doing, thereby providing vital information regarding locations of the forward troops.
     Later, when given an opportunity to rest, he assisted in the evacuation of Sepoy casualties from the forward area.
     Throughout these operations Lance Bombardier McQUEEN has displayed outstanding bravery, initiative and boldness which were an inspiration to all those around him.

The leading section of 6 Platoon, having advanced 100 yards beyond Point 325, came under light automatic fire at close range and one man of the sectio0n was wounded.   Without waiting for orders, Sergeant HAYE immediately seized a Light Machine Gun and with this weapon and his Sten gun rushed forward alone and killed single handed three Chinese, who were dug in behind a small hill 100 yards ahead of the leading section.
     Sergeant HAYE's complete disregard for his own personal safety, coupled with his own prompt action and skill, were not only an inspiration to his platoon, which immediately continued its advance, but were probably instrumental in saving further casualties.

Citation:   Cpl BARKER has been a patrol commander and acting platoon Sergeant for the last 5 months.   He has led his patrol with great dash and has shown an outstanding determination to seek out and engage the enemy in the forest.
     On 16 November 1955 Cpl Barker led his patrol from a forest base up the Gura river, searching the area for a suspected Mau Mau camp.   He directed his trackers with skill and led his patrol in an immediate charge into the camp.   Cpl Barker firing his Patchett personally killed one of the gang leaders and wounded 2 others who escaped.   From the camp 7 rounds of Dum Dum .303 bullets, two Simis and all the gang documents and dairies which were of intelligence importance were recovered.
     On the 2nd December 1955, Cpl Barker led a patrol from MUNYANGE Camp and picked up tracks of 3 Mau Mau at the forest edge.   He followed these tracks for some 5 miles including a crossing of the GURA River.   Cpl Barker happened to be leading the patrol when he saw a Mau Mau coming down the track towards him.   Cpl Barker shot him dead at 25 yards range.   He immediately led his patrol at speed back tracking this Mau Mau.   As the patrol was proceeding along a very steep hill , Sgt Mitchell, the Kenya Regiment Sergeant, attached to his patrol for liaison duties and as an interpreter, slipped and fell down the steep hill and accidentally shot and wounded himself in the leg.   This was about 1530hours.   Sgt Mitchell was unable to walk and was about six miles from the camp.   Cpl Barker immediately organised his evacuation and gave him medical attention.   Having got Sgt Mitchell half way back to this patrol base, Cpl Barker ran on ahead with only a tracker with him to get help and organise the rescue.   Cpl Barker's patrol carried Sgt Mitchell all night through very difficult forest and across the fast flowing mountain river Gura.   Sgt Mitchell reached the coy base after dawn the next day.
     Cpl Barker and his patrol, performed a great feat of non stop physical endurance during that 24 hours.

As this regiment was operating on the extreme left flank of the Eighth Army the only other link with the 6th Lancers went back through many higher formations to Fifth Army ans so forward again and accordingly the signal line was of great importance in maintaining co0operation.   The line party of two was consistently and persistently shelled on the open ground South East Of MODIGLIANA (M.2309) but both linesmen never slackened their efforts and spent over two yours under heavy shell and mortar fire - much of it observed - repairing the new breaks in the line which the shellfire was constantly causing.   Some of the work had to be done standing waist deep in the river in full view of enemy O.Ps on the opposite hills.   Finally the shelling ceased and the pair mended the last break and reported their work completed.    Mtn. Scott acted throughout with great courage, coolness and devotion to duty.

Citation:   Throughout the Italian Campaign Corporal STEWART has done outstanding work.
     On numerous occasions he has been under heavy artillery, mortar and small arms fire.   Nevertheless he has remained at his post and with the greatest coolness and determination has continued to exercise control of traffic at the vital points at which he has been stationed.
     Shortage of personnel has put a great strain on the Provost available, necessitating long hours on duty without relief.   In spite of this, Corporal Stewart has at all times and in all weathers performed hid duties cheerfully and supremely well.
     By his courage, efficiency and devotion to duty, he has set a most inspiring example to all serving with him and has helped materially to maintain the morale and efficiency of 1 Canadian Provost Company at the highest level.

Citation for the Belgian Croix de Guerre with Bronze Star to L/Cpl Parry CMP: At approximately 18.00 hrs the Military policeman, who was on point duty where tanks were crossing the main road EAST of RANVILLE, was killed on his point.  (L/Cpl Stead)  L/Cpl PARRY was detailed to take over this point.   In spite of intense enemy shelling L/Cpl PARRY proceeded to control the traffic as though the situation was perfectly normal.   There is no doubt that the steadfastness and imperturbability of this L/Cpl was an source of inspiration to the drivers of all passing vehicles and his courage enabled a considerable congestion of vehicles at this point to be avoided.

I wish to bring to your notice the following facts.   for some time past I have suspected that illegal sales of by-products have been taking lace from out cookhouse bur we have been unable to trace them.   On the 16th instant, No. P/16029 L/cpl C H Fox, MFP very cleverly caught one of the cooks in the unlawful act of selling dripping to the swill contractor.   The Contractor, Mr E Brooks, has been convicted and fined in a Civil Court and the cook remanded for Court Martial.   I consider that Lance Corporal Fox should be commended for this smart capture.

Citation: British Forces Palestine - Trans Jordan.   2 Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers, 18 Infantry Brigade.
On the morning of the 25th November 1938, when a column of the 2 Battalion, The Royal Irish Fusiliers, encountered a gang of from 15 to 20 bandits in the hills near AMQA, Fusilier COLEMAN was one of a handful of men who dashed forward at once with Lieutenant MORRIS to get to close quarters with the band.   When a party of enemy attempted to break back through them to the cover of a wadi, Fusilier COLEMAN engaged them at close quarters and by his coolness and determination prevented them doing so, himself killing three of the enemy.
